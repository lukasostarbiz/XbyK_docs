# KentiCopilot
As a developer building digital experiences with Xperience by Kentico, you know productivity thrives when you stay in flow. The need to constantly switch context between an assortment of tools and search through documentation is a major speed bump for development. That’s why we created **KentiCopilot**.
## Meet KentiCopilot
**KentiCopilot** is an initiative to help developers effectively and responsibly adopt AI in developing Xperience by Kentico projects.
Think of KentiCopilot as an umbrella term for all the tools, features, and educational materials we create to help developers work smarter with AI. If you’re familiar with [AIRA](/documentation/business-users/aira), that solution is built for content editors and marketers inside the Xperience administration interface. KentiCopilot brings together multiple elements for developers.
In the upcoming months, we’ll create:
  * **An AI-powered coding assistant** integrated directly into your IDE to keep you in context and accelerate your workflow.
  * **Educational resources and best practices** to guide you in building secure, scalable, and maintainable solutions.
  * **Real-world examples and community insights** to show how AI can improve development speed and quality.


## What you can expect from KentiCopilot
The goal of KentiCopilot is to deliver developer-first assistance that accelerates your workflow and empowers you with knowledge:
  * _Develop faster:_ Get intelligent suggestions and insights as you code.
  * _Simplify migrations:_ Streamline bringing content from legacy systems.
  * _Connect seamlessly:_ Integrate with other developer tools and data sources.
  * _Learn continuously:_ Access curated resources, webinars, and examples to master AI-assisted development.
  * _Build with confidence:_ Apply best practices for building secure, performant, and maintainable Xperience applications when using AI in your projects.


KentiCopilot isn’t just about an assistant that helps you write code. It’s about helping you become an AI-ready developer.
## KentiCopilot repository
To get started with AI-assisted development, visit our [KentiCopilot repository](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-kenticopilot), which provides pre-configured prompts and instructions for common Xperience development tasks with popular AI coding assistants.
The repository includes:
  * **Ready-to-use prompts** for GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code (transferrable to other AI assistants) currently covering the following scenarios:
    * Kentico 13 live site presentation and business logic migration to Xperience by Kentico projects.
    * [Page Builder](/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder) widget development.
  * **Step-by-step setup instructions** to integrate prompts into your Xperience projects


Whether you’re creating custom widgets, working with content types, or building integrations, these prompts help you maintain context and write better code faster.
## Documentation access
Enable your AI coding assistant to access complete, up-to-date Xperience by Kentico documentation directly within your IDE. The Xperience Documentation MCP server puts complete documentation, training guides, API examples, and implementation tips right at your fingertips.
* * *
[Documentation MCP server](/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/mcp-server)
Learn how to install the Documentation MCP server to provide your AI assistant with real-time access to Kentico documentation through semantic search and content retrieval. The MCP server supports VS Code, Visual Studio, Claude Desktop, and Cursor.
* * *
## Content type management
Enable your agentic coding assistant to interface with Xperience by Kentico’s database to work with content types without even opening the administration interface.
* * *
[Analyze content type relationships](/guides/development/kenticopilot/analyze-content-type-relationships) HOW-TO
Use your agentic coding assistant to generate a concise summary of content types and their relationships, rather than manually clicking through dozens of content types and their fields to learn how they relate.
* * *
## Widget implementation
Rapidly implement functional widgets with detailed prompts and reference materials from the KentiCopilot repository.
* * *
[Rapidly implement widgets with KentiCopilot](/guides/development/kenticopilot/implement-widgets-kenticopilot) HOW-TO
Watch a five-minute demo showing widget implementation from start to finish, then use the detailed prompts and requirements templates from the KentiCopilot repository to build your own widgets with AI assistance.
