As a developer building digital experiences with Xperience by Kentico, you know productivity thrives when you stay in flow. The need to constantly switch context between an assortment of tools and search through documentation is a major speed bump for development. That’s why we created **KentiCopilot**.
## Meet KentiCopilot
**KentiCopilot** is an initiative to help developers effectively and responsibly adopt AI in developing Xperience by Kentico projects.
Think of KentiCopilot as an umbrella term for all the tools, features, and educational materials we create to help developers work smarter with AI. If you’re familiar with [AIRA](documentation/business-users/aira), that solution is built for content editors and marketers inside the Xperience administration interface. KentiCopilot brings together multiple elements for developers.
In the upcoming months, we’ll create:
  * **An AI-powered coding assistant** integrated directly into your IDE to keep you in context and accelerate your workflow.
  * **Educational resources and best practices** to guide you in building secure, scalable, and maintainable solutions.
  * **Real-world examples and community insights** to show how AI can improve development speed and quality.


## What you can expect from KentiCopilot
The goal of KentiCopilot is to deliver developer-first assistance that accelerates your workflow and empowers you with knowledge:
  * _Develop faster:_ Get intelligent suggestions and insights as you code.
  * _Simplify migrations:_ Streamline bringing content from legacy systems.
  * _Connect seamlessly:_ Integrate with other developer tools and data sources.
  * _Learn continuously:_ Access curated resources, webinars, and examples to master AI-assisted development.
  * _Build with confidence:_ Apply best practices for building secure, performant, and maintainable Xperience applications when using AI in your projects.


KentiCopilot isn’t just about an assistant that helps you write code. It’s about helping you become an AI-ready developer.
