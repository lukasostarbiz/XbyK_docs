No two project upgrades are the same, but diving into more technical example scenarios will help you familiarize yourself with the available tools.
These scenarios highlight more advanced use cases than those covered in the [upgrade walkthrough](guides/architecture/upgrade-from-kx13/upgrade-walkthrough) from the [Architecture guides](guides/architecture).
If you haven’t already seen our [upgrade overview materials](guides/architecture/upgrade-from-kx13) and followed the [basic walkthrough](guides/architecture/upgrade-from-kx13/upgrade-walkthrough), we recommend checking them out before these guides.
