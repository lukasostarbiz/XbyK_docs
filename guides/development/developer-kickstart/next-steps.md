At this point, you have a basic knowledge of how building a simple website in Xperience by Kentico works.
You’ve learned how to create Xperience projects, leverage the Content hub to store and reference **reusable content** , and display structured data with **page templates**. You’ve also used Page Builder to add unstructured content to your pages and built a **dynamic navigation menu**.
## Continue learning
The best place to continue learning about the Xperience by Kentico is our set of [guides for developers](guides/development).
Follow the step-by-step instructions and discover how to work with Page Builder, data protection, activities tracking, how to set up multilingual, customize the administration UI, and more.
The guides outline a learning path and explain Xperience development practices and concepts using practical examples and real-life use-cases.
#### Learn by doing
Our Guides heavily rely on code samples that all come from the [Training guides repository](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-training-guides), a working Xperience by Kentico project.
Pull the **main** branch and use it as a starting point to follow along with the guides (starting from [Development utilities](guides/development#development-utilities)). Or take a look at the **finished** branch to see the completed implementation of all the examples, following our recommended best practices.
