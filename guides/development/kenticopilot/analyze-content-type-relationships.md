# Analyze content type relationships
With the _Content type management API_ , your agentic code assistant can examine the relationships between content types in Xperience by Kentico to help bring new developers up to speed on existing projects.
Receive a coherent, concise summary of types and their relationships, rather than manually clicking through dozens of content types and their fields in the admin UI.
To enable the content type management API and the MCP server, follow the [instructions in the documentation](/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types/management-api).
