# Generate code for custom content and data classes
Xperience by Kentico allows you to generate strongly-typed code files for working with content types, module classes, and forms defined in the administration interface using the [_.NET Command Line Interface_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/). 
While the process is described in [the documentation](/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/generate-code-files-for-system-objects), seeing a walkthrough is often helpful.
In this video, Sean Wright walks through generating various kinds of code files using different options in the CLI and creating a PowerShell script to automate the process.
The following video shows Xperience by Kentico release v26. Some CLI commands for code generators have been updated to include new Xperience features. Find out more information about code generators in the product [Changelog](/documentation/changelog).
