Welcome to the Developer Learning Map for Xperience by Kentico. This curated collection of training materials, documentation articles, and additional resources is structured to guide you through the sequential learning process tailored for developers.
We have put together this collection for developers working with Kentico 12 or Kentico 13 and those new to the Kentico community. These guides are organized in a recommended order to help you navigate different materials. If you are new to certain aspects of .NET framework or specific parts of Xperience by Kentico development, you will find links to resources that will prepare you before you dive into more detailed Kentico-specific information.
Are you a visual learner? You can find the same resources organized [into a roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/r?id=66bdc03491320df4bddcabc8).
## 1. Xperience development basics
You’ll learn the basics of application and development setup, how to leverage CI/CD processes to enhance solutions’ scalability and robustness, and how the channels work. Xperience by Kentico does not use Entity Framework but its own API layer for efficient content handling.
**Development basics prerequisites**
Before you start with Xperience development basics, ensure that you understand the basics of .NET 8 and develop applications with the MVC pattern. If you are new to the .NET framework, you might find the following resources helpful. (Kentico did not create these resources, and payment might be required to access them.)
  * [Get started with ASP.NET Core MVC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-8.0&tabs=visual-studio), as the MVC is the recommended development pattern.
  * [Host and deploy ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/?view=aspnetcore-8.0) – Learn the basics of deploying ASP.NET Core applications in Microsoft documentation.

  * [Pluralsight: ASP.NET Core tutorial](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/aspnet-core-fundamentals) – Learn all the features you’ll need to build ASP.NET Core applications.
  * [.NET Developer roadmap in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oeMTz7LwrU) – If you are new to .NET framework, see an unofficial roadmap for learning .NET development presented by Nick Chapsas, Microsoft MVP.
