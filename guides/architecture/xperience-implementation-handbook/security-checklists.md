# Security checklists
Following the security checklists found in this section can help you keep your projects secure from start to finish. By making the checklists part of your workflow and revisiting them regularly, you can ensure security stays a continuous priority for your project rather than a one-time task. This approach helps you reduce risks from early on, maintain compliance, and avoid costly fixes later in development.
## This section is for you if you…
  * Are a developer, admin, software architect, or security professional working with Xperience by Kentico.
  * Want to ensure your project follows security best practices throughout its lifecycle.
  * Need a structured approach to identifying and addressing security considerations.
  * Prefer having actionable checklists to guide your security implementation.


## What this section covers
The following pages provide phase-specific security checklists that cover the entire project lifecycle:
  1. [Security checklist - design phase](/guides/architecture/xperience-implementation-handbook/security-checklists/security-checklist-design-phase) – things to consider before you begin developing your project
  2. [Security checklist - development phase](/guides/architecture/xperience-implementation-handbook/security-checklists/security-checklist-development-phase) – things to keep in mind while developing your project
  3. [Security checklist - deployment phase](/guides/architecture/xperience-implementation-handbook/security-checklists/security-checklist-deployment-phase) – tasks to do before you deploy your project to a live environment
