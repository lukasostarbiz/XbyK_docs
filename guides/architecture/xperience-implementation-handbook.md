Leverage the collective experience of Kentico solution architects to implement best practices and avoid pitfalls as you build your Xperience by Kentico project. We identified seven primary phases for Xperience by Kentico projects. Depending on your development lifecycle, you may pass over these steps sequentially or in an iterative manner. Additionally, our security experts put together three security checklists for things to keep in mind during planning, development and deployment of your projects.
Regardless of the approach you take, each phase covers the key concepts and best practices you need to know, and provides additional resources related to the section.
