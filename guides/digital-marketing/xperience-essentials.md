## Managing digital experiences with Xperience by Kentico
Today, website visitors expect to get what they come for instantly. If they aren’t satisfied, they leave. As a marketer, you no longer manage just the content of the website, you manage the whole digital experience your visitors and customers get when they interact with your brand. This leads to the emergence of digital experience platforms, in short, DXPs.
### What is a DXP?
A digital experience platform (DXP) helps you create, manage, deliver, and personalize your customers’ digital experiences.
Rather than a collection of different services that marketers use independently from one another, a DXP integrates different technologies you can use to analyze your customers’ interactions with your brand across different channels and customize their digital experiences. See the [DXP Hub](https://kentico.com/discover/dxp-hub) to find out more.
**Xperience by Kentico** is a [digital experience platform](https://www.kentico.com/discover/what-is-a-dxp) developed by [Kentico](https://www.kentico.com/about), company with 20+ years of experience with delivering innovative digital experience solutions to the market. You can use _Xperience_ to manage all your digital marketing content, collect your website visitor data, and personalize your visitors’ journeys.
