See how you can set up cross-site tracking in Xperience by Kentico.
  1. Open the **Cross-site tracking** application and select **New tracked** **website**.

  3. Add any **Website code name**.
  4. To the **Website URL** field, add your external website’s domain name with the _https_ protocol, e.g., _https://example.com_.
  5. Select the **Website channel** representing the main Xperience website to which the external site will be linked.
  6. **Save** your changes to generate the cross-site tracking script.
