Knowing how exactly your visitors navigate and what content they consume through your digital content brings you invaluable insights for defining and optimizing your customer journeys. Xperience’s Contact activity tracking allows you to track and analyze how contacts engage with your website, including their browsing patterns, content consumption, form submissions, downloads, and other activities. Once enabled by the developers, Xperience assigns a contact ID to any compliant visitor and records this contact’s actions and behavior.
