Learn how easy it is to upload and optimize assets in **Xperience by Kentico** in our step-by-step interactive demo.
This interactive walkthrough was prepared in **Kbank** , our demo website environment. If you’d like to follow along, or if you simply want to know what it’s like working with [Xperience by Kentico](https://www.kentico.com/platforms/xperience-by-kentico), try our Kbank demo website. You can request your demo site through the form at [Kentico website](https://www.kentico.com/services/training/training-website-requests) and ask for the _Xperience by Kentico – Business Tutorial Kbank demo site_. Once you approve the request, we will automatically send you a link to your demo site.
To get a hands on experience with managing assests in _Xperience_ , download our [sample asset file](https://download.kentico.com/Training/sample_assets_pet-insurance-campaign.zip), and give it a go. You might notice that we’re working with an ad hoc sample campaign page called _Pet insurance_ in our demo. This example does not come out-of-the-box with _Kbank_ , but you can easily create a page such as the one we’re using by following steps in our guide on [campaign page creation](guides/digital-marketing/work-with-websites/create-a-new-campaign-page).
## Upload and optimize image assets
In this short demo, you’ll learn how to upload images into the **Content hub** and how to keep them organized. You’ll also see how Xperience automatically prepares the uploaded images for use across your websites and campaigns.
You’ll walk through:
  * Creating a project folder.
  * Uploading images in bulk.
  * Understanding how Xperience and [AIRA](documentation/business-users/aira) automatically generate alt text, focal points, and image variants.
  * Adding your newly uploaded asset to a page.


By the end, you’ll know the essential steps to get high-quality visuals into Xperience quickly and with much less manual effort.
## Wrap up
Great job completing this walkthrough! You’ve learned how to upload images, stay organized with folders, and use Xperience’s automation, like having **AIRA automatically generate alt text for accessibility, detect focal points so key parts of images appear as intended, and create variant sizes for use in different places**. You also saw how easily these assets can be reused across your pages, keeping your visuals consistent and your workflow efficient.
