# Contact groups overview
Contact groups in Xperience are segments created from contacts in your database. You define the sorting conditions when you create a new group using Xperience’s visual condition builder. Once a contact fulfills these conditions, Xperience automatically adds them to the respective groups. Or, if needed, you can add or remove criteria in an existing contact group.
Xperience automatically checks if a new or updated contact fulfills the contact group’s conditions and adds or removes the contact accordingly. Any single contact can also belong to any number of different contact groups.
For example, your contact can fall into a contact group that collects _frequent product buyers_ , a second group of _newsletter subscribers_ , and a third group that includes all visitors _who have visited specific pages but have yet to submit an online form_ on those pages.
