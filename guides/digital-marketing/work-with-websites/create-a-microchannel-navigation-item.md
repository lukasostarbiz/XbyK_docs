# Create a microchannel navigation item
This guide walks you through the steps to add a navigation menu item for your microchannel. You’ll learn how to create new content items for the menu, reorder them for clarity, and add external links when needed.
In microchannels (smaller or single-purpose sites), navigation menus are simple and usually contain only a few items. How you manage navigation in a microsite depends on how the project is set up. A common and recommended option is to use a dedicated settings element in the content tree. Editors can use this element to configure navigation and other settings specific to the microchannel. For navigation, they choose which items appear in the menu and arrange them in the order that matches the desired structure.
**Prerequisites** : you have a [Kbank demo site](https://www.kentico.com/services/training/training-website-requests) Kbank demo site running to follow along with the exercise.
## Add a navigation menu item to a microchannel
The _Mortgages Microsite_ **Settings** page includes two sections for managing site menus: Top navigation and Footer links.
  * In the _Top navigation_ section, editors can add new links or update existing ones that appear in the main menu at the top of the site.
  * In the _Footer links_ section, editors can do the same for the set of links displayed in the site’s footer.


Both menus are single-layer by design, since the Kbank Mortgages site is a simple microsite with only a few pages. Instead of relying on hardcoded navigation, which is a common approach in microsites, Kbank editors don’t need to ask developers for help if they want to keep menus up to date.
Let’s add a new navigation menu item to the _Top navigation_ section which will link back to the _Personal Banking_ website.
  1. In the **Channels** application, navigate to the _Mortgages Microsite_ microchannel.  

  2. Select the **Settings** page in the content tree.  

  3. In **Settings** , select **Edit page**. The _Top navigation_ and _Footer links_ sections are available.
  4. In the _Top navigation_ section, select **Create new**.
  5. In the _Content item name_ field, enter the name “Personal Banking”.
  6. **Continue**.
  7. In the next step, enter the **Caption** corresponding to the _Content item name_. This is the text that will appear in the menu.
  8. Add a link using **Link to external URL**. Enter the full URL of the main page from the _Personal Banking_ channel (for example, _https://www.example.com/personal_).
  9. **Publish** your new navigation item.
  10. Finally, **Publish** the new navigation menu.


The new _Personal Banking_ navigation item is now included in the microchannel’s top navigation menu.
## Tips for microchannel navigation
  * **Agree with your team first:** Always confirm the menu structure before creating it.
  * **Keep menus short:** Aim for 3 - 5 items. Microsites work best with small and simple menus because they contain only a few pages. They usually serve a single purpose, and their visitors don’t need complex menus to find what they’re looking for.
  * **Align navigation menu with the microsite’s purpose:** Every link should directly support the main goal of the microsite (e.g., product signup, campaign awareness, lead generation). Avoid adding unrelated links that could distract visitors.
  * **Consider a footer for secondary links:** If you need to include less important pages (privacy policy, legal notices, etc.), place them in a simple footer navigation instead of the top menu.


## Next steps
You’ve now created a navigation menu item for your microchannel. A well-structured menu helps visitors quickly find what they need and improves their experience on your site. As your microchannel grows, revisit your navigation to keep it clear and relevant.
