## Wrap up
In this walkthrough, we covered how to:
  * Understand the role of [Recipient lists](/guides/digital-marketing/work-with-email/create-a-recipient-list) and [Contact groups](/guides/digital-marketing/work-with-contacts/contact-groups-overview) when segmenting your email audience.
  * Create a **regular marketing email** using a structured email template with the **Email Builder** enabled.
  * Build promotional email content in a drag-and-drop builder using **widgets**.
  * Refine your audience by applying **include** and **exclude** conditions based on _Contact groups_.

With these basics in place, you can confidently deliver targeted marketing messages to the right audience without fragmenting your contacts into new, unnecessary recipient lists.
