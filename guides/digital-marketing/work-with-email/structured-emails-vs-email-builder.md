  * Structured emails and Email Builder in Xperience 


# Structured emails and Email Builder in Xperience
**Xperience by Kentico** includes a built‑in email marketing feature that lets you design, send, and track emails directly within the platform.
You can create marketing emails in Xperience in two primary ways: using **structured emails** or the **Email Builder**. Each approach offers you different benefits; depending on what you want to achieve, your level of technical comfort, and the level of control you need over the final look and personalized content. If you’re a little unsure on which approach to email is best for you, you’ve come to the right place.
We’ll walk you through:
  * What structured and builder-based emails are.
  * The pros and cons of each approach.
  * Choosing the right one for your scenario.
  * A look at how you can combine both methods in advanced email workflows.


By the end, you’ll feel more confident deciding how to create emails that match your needs, whether you’re sending recurring newsletters, running targeted mail blasts, or experimenting with AI-powered content creation.
The example of email template we’re showing uses our Kbank demo website that lets you try out what it’s like working with [Xperience by Kentico](https://www.kentico.com/platforms/xperience-by-kentico) in a safe, sandbox environment.
If you don’t have your demo site yet, request it through the form at [Kentico website](https://www.kentico.com/services/training/training-website-requests) and request the _Xperience by Kentico – Business Tutorial Kbank demo site_. Once you approve the request, we will automatically send you a link to the demo site.
## Understand structured data in emails – structure and ease of mind
Structured emails use **ready-made content fields that you simply fill out**. They can be as simple as a title, image, and a text field to store the email body. Or, depending on their [purpose](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails#email-purposes), they can contain many different fields that add data to email sections, such as a subtitle field, a summary field, and a selector for recently published articles. You could also add another section for promoting new services and then another group of fields to provide a link collection for interesting articles.
There’s no drag-and-drop interface or visual design process involved. Instead, developers build the structure and layout in advance, so you don’t need to look out for visual consistency and brand control.
To see simple or more complex structured emails in action, check out the _Simple email_ and _Newsletter email_ templates in the **Kbank** demo website. These emails are an excellent fit for high-volume, repeatable mailouts where speed and consistency matter more than layout creativity.

### How structured emails work
Structured emails are built in such a way as to make them **predictable, fast to use, and reliable** in layout. Here’s what makes them special:
  * They’re created from structured content types, and their editing resembles working with content in the Content Hub.
  * You can edit them only through form fields; no visual design tools are needed.
  * Developers prepare templates that handle layout and content rendering without editor intervention.
  * They’re designed with business users in mind for cases when you need to quickly add your content and hit “Send”.


No hassle, all play – you can use the structure provided by the predefined sections, and focus all your creative energies on **what you want to tell** your audience instead of the **how**.
### Key benefits of structured emails
The main strengths of structured emails are the time they save you, the fact that their look will always display as the developers and graphic designers intended, and the possibility of integrating automation. Let’s break down some of the most helpful benefits.
#### Fast and focused creation
Structured emails are designed for efficiency. You enter content into the email fields, hit publish, and you’re done.
  * The template defines the styling and layout, you just enter your content and publish.
  * Structured emails help when you need to move fast but not sacrifice quality.
  * Ideal for regularly sent updates, newsletters, or product alerts.


#### Strict template control
Because developers handle the layout, you never need to worry about branding or formatting errors.
  * Developers ensure everything stays on brand.
  * You can’t accidentally break layouts or introduce off-brand elements.
  * Great for organizations with strong brand governance.


#### AIRA-powered editing with Xperience AIRA
_Xperience by Kentico_ introduces [**AIRA**](/documentation/business-users/aira), your friendly agent that helps make structured email creation even faster and more polished. You still provide the raw content, but you can leave the difficult task of putting everything into the right words to AIRA, nice and neat.
Save time and improve the quality of your writing with AI-assisted features:
  * **Summarize** or **rewrite** content based on a prompt you give.
  * **Generate new content** from linked data items like product or event entries.
  * **Stay on tone and aligned with brand voice** ; no manual tweaking is needed.

## Explore Email Builder and create emails that catch the eye
The _Email Builder_ offers a visual, drag-and-drop experience for creating emails. Similar to Xperience’s **Page Builder** , it lets you put together content using developer-configured **email widgets** inside customizable **email sections**.
[![Email Builder developer-built widgets and customizable sections](/docsassets/guides/structured-emails-vs-email-builder/email-builder-widgets-and-sections.png)](/docsassets/guides/structured-emails-vs-email-builder/email-builder-widgets-and-sections.png)
This approach is perfect if you want more flexibility in how your content looks, whether you’re crafting a one-off blast or tailoring messages for different audiences.
### How does Email Builder work
Unlike [structured emails](#how-structured-emails-work), where you fill a pre-set form with your content, _Email Builder_ gives you the freedom to build your message visually, using a what-you-see-is-what-you-get approach.
With _Email Builder_ , you can:
  * Build emails by dragging sections and widgets into place.
  * You can see your layout changes as you work.
  * Use widgets that provide editable fields and optional style controls.


### Key benefits of Email Builder
The _Email Builder_ gives you more creative control while keeping developers in the loop through widget restrictions and styling options. But what does that look like in practice?
#### Visual editing experience
You can see your email as you’re building it; no need to preview or guess.
  * You can edit right on the open canvas of the builder and see changes immediately.
  * See what you’re building in real time and make changes on the spot.
  * Great for collaborative work between marketers and designers. Plan your email requirements with your developers, get the widgets built, and then you can take it from there.


#### Styling and layout flexibility
Your developers set up the widgets for you. They can even add styling options so you can adjust the color, size of the text, or the content layout without breaking the brand design guidelines.
  * Developers can make widget styling options (like spacing, fonts, and background colors) available.
  * This gives you more freedom while still staying within approved design rules.
  * It also helps marketing teams quickly prototype and fine-tune layouts.


#### Contact group-based personalization
_Email Builder_ widgets allow you to personalize email content using Contact groups, just like you would in the [Page Builder](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/widget-personalization).
This means you can tailor sections of your email content to different segments of your audience, without needing to duplicate the entire email, or leave the _Email Builder_ environment.
_Email Builder_ makes it easy to:
  * Show different content to different personas using **Contact groups**.
  * Tailor messages for new customers, loyal subscribers, or re-engagement messaging.
  * This approach is currently supported only in _Email Builder_.

## Comparing structured emails and Email Builder emails
Let’s compare the two approaches across different criteria. This side-by-side table can help you quickly **assess which method better suits your marketing email strategy**.
However, feel free to take an individual approach where you see fit. The rules aren’t set in stone, and what might work for you may be a specific case outside the scope of this material.
In short, don’t be afraid to try out both email types for different scenarios, especially if you have already downloaded your Kbank demo website and are ready to experiment.
Feature |  Structured email |  Email Builder  
---|---|---  
Editing experience |  Form-based (structured content types) |  Visual editor with drag-and-drop widgets and customizable sections  
Layout control |  None (handled by a template prepared by developers) |  Medium (customizable within widget, sections and template properties)  
Speed of authoring |  Very fast |  Medium (setup and layout require more time)  
Personalization by persona |  Not supported |  Partially supported (contact group-based widget variants)  
Design consistency |  Guaranteed by developer templates |  Enforced through developer-defined widget restrictions  
AI (Xperience [AIRA](/documentation/business-users/aira) integration) |  Supported (text summarization, enhancement, and generation) |  Not currently supported  
Ideal use case |  Recurring, simple emails with fixed layout where the focus on content is key |  Emails where layout flexibility or audience-specific content is needed

## When to use structured emails
**Structured emails** shine in situations where **speed and consistency** are your top priorities. They’re built for repeatable tasks and are ideal when the content follows a predictable structure. You can forget difficult layout decisions, styling worries, or the risk of going off-brand.
If you’re working on emails that don’t need layout flexibility or personalization, and you just want to get the message out, structured emails are likely the best fit.
Choose **structured emails** when:
  * You send repeatable emails like a weekly newsletter or event update.
  * You want to write quickly and avoid layout or design decisions.
  * Your brand requires strict consistency across all messaging, including emails.
  * You want to use **AIRA** to streamline writing or generate content from your prompts.
  * Your email editors are still learning. It’s easier if they can focus on content and not layout.
  * When you want to simplify your email workflow.


### Structued emails in a real-life marketing scenario
Let’s say you’re managing product updates. Every month, you want to notify customers about new features or changes in the existing product.
With structured emails, you just plug in the product name, short description, and link. AIRA helps polish your copy to perfection, and you send the email within minutes, knowing that it matches your brand template.

## When to use the Email Builder
The _Email Builder_ is designed for flexibility. If your emails vary in structure, target different audiences, or need more hands-on control over how they look, this is where the _Email Builder_ shines. It’s especially handy when you’re tailoring content to different groups of recipients or simply want to get a more creative editing experience.
Using _Email Builder_ is ideal when you collaborate with designers, use a variety of content formats, or need to customize parts of your emails while staying within brand limits.
Choose the **Email Builder** when:
  * You want a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) interface.
  * You plan to send personalized email blasts (e.g., upsells for loyal users vs. how-to guides for new ones).
  * Your layout needs vary across your messaging. For example, one week, you may need side-by-side images, and the next, a new hero block.
  * Your emails need to stand out with customized structure and flow.


### Email Builder in a real-life marketing scenario
Imagine you’re launching a multi-day promotional email blitz for your online store. You want to showcase different products and draw attention with tailored hero banners.
The _Email Builder_ lets you mix content types, apply dynamic content for different customer groups, and visually build it all in one place.

## Combine both email approaches
Combining both email approaches can be a smart choice for many teams. When your email strategy gets more advanced, pairing structured content with _Email Builder_ gives you the best of both worlds.
This hybrid approach balances the **consistency of a ready-made layout** and the **creative freedom of widgets you can experiment with**.
Using structured fields for stable, reusable parts of the email (like headers, legal disclaimers, or product summaries) helps you move fast. Meanwhile, _Email Builder_ lets you personalize or customize parts of the email as needed.
For example:
  * Use **structured content** to provide consistent headers, product blurbs, or legal text.
  * Add **flexible widgets** to personalize content by audience or feature interactive sections.
  * Ask developers to implement an [**advanced widget**](/guides/development/page-builder/define-advanced-widget) to get widgets tailored to your needs, but without the need to do more than drop in your content and be ready to send.


This hybrid setup gives you the best of both worlds because you don’t have to choose. Combine the power of both methods and benefit from structured sections with flexible widgets:
  * Speed and consistency from structured fields.
  * Flexibility and dynamic targeting through the _Email Builder_.


While this isn’t fully showcased in our Kbank demo yet, the capability is already [available in Xperience](/guides/development/email-marketing/display-structured-content-email-builder), so why not explore its capabilities as your email strategy matures?
