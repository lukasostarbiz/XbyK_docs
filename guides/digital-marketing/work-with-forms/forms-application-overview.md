# Forms application overview
The forms on your website can help you gather your customers, suppliers, or partners’ data. You can create different forms using the **Forms** application. You can create simple forms your customers use to send you a message, such as _Contact Us_. After they submit, they can see a short personalized “Thank you” message on the live site. Or, you can build forms that trigger more complex logic, such as sending a customer a “Thank you” autoresponder email or even automatically subscribing them to a newsletter.
