# Create a new form
Learn how to create a new form from scratch and add the form fields, adjusting them to create smooth user experience.
Starting with this page, we walk through our example scenarios in Xperience by Kentico’s [Kbank demo website](https://www.kentico.com/services/training/training-website-requests). To work along with us in this safe sandbox environment, you can request a hosted trial at the link above by selecting the following option: _Xperience by Kentico - Business Tutorial KBank demo site_.
  1. In Kbank administration, navigate to the **Forms** application, and select **New form** to open the _Form builder_.
  2. Use the (**+**) plus button in the middle of the form filed and add a field of your choice.
  3. Click the **Configure** button to adjust field’s properties:
    1. **Label** is the description shown before the field (e.g. “First name”). Adjust it as needed so your contacts know what data they are supposed to provide.
    2. Tick the **Required** checkbox if customers have to provide value to this field before they submit the online form.
    3. The **Name** is a unique identifier of the form field. Set the Name value only when you create the form and do not change it. 
      1. Change the _Name_ only when you create the form. If you change the name later, it might cause problems with the form’s functionality.
    4. Modify other field properties to give a hint or clarify any additional requirements: 
      1. **Default value** is a pre-filled value in the field, the contact can follow with their input.
      2. **Explanation text** shows under the field in smaller font size and can be used as a more detailed description of the field.
      3. **Tooltip** will appear when a contact hovers their mouse over the field.
      4. **Placeholder** shows in the field as a text in a lighter color that disappears when your contact adds any value into the field.
  4. Similarly, add further fields you want to include into your online form.
You can use validation rules to make sure people enter the right kind of information in your form fields. For example, you can limit the number of characters in a text field or set a maximum value for numbers. Keep in mind: Validation rules don’t apply to empty fields. If you want to make sure a field is filled in, mark it as _Required_ in the field’s properties.

  5. If necessary, reorder the fields within the form by dragging-and-dropping the components using the purple ribbon.
  6. Switch to the **General** tab and update your form’s **Name**.


Depending on your website implementation, you might also be able to group forms fields into sections to give the whole group of fields some pre-defined behavior. For example, you can add a title to your form section or show form fields distributed into two columns. To adjust the layout of your form, select **Change section type** on the field banner. To add a new form section, use the (+) plus button on the side.
