  1. Go to the **Users** application.
  2. Select **New user** , fill in their information, and save the changes.
  3. When you create a new user, Xperience sends them a confirmation email.
  4. As an **Administrator** with appropriate permissions, you can change other users’ credentials. In the Users application, find and edit the user.
