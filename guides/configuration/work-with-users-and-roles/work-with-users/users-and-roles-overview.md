# Users and roles overview
### Users and roles overview
Users sign in daily to your website’s administration interface and create new articles, personalize content for different audiences, build new online forms, or monitor the system’s performance. 
**Users** in Xperience by Kentico work with the applications from the back end - they create content, define marketing activities, etc. A typical user, for example, adds website articles or creates personalized content variants.
Administrators create different **roles** to define user **permissions** and access to applications.
You can assign one role to more users. For example, you can have several users with a _Content editor_ role that can add or edit articles and other website pages or update content across the website.
Administrators can also assign multiple roles to the same user. Permissions granted within each role are cumulative. For example, if a user has a _Content editor_ role and a _Digital marketer_ role, permissions from both roles apply.
Admins assign these _roles_ to users, such as marketers, editors, and data protection officers. 
Visitors who create their accounts in your application are called **members**. Unlike _Users_ who can access the Xperience administration, _members_ can access only the front-facing part of your application, such as a website. They can browse pages or access member-only sections of the website.
