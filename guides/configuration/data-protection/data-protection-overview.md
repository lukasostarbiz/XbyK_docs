Xperience **Data Protection** helps organizations comply with data protection and privacy regulations, such as the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) in the European Union. Once prepared by the developers, it helps manage and protect personal data collected and processed within the Xperience application. Xperience provides a unified interface you can use to:
  * Manage your clients’ consent regarding their personal data.
  * Handle their requests to access or remove their data.
  * Anonymize and encrypt their data to prevent unauthorized access.


Xperience by Kentico’s _Data protection_ feature creates a secure and privacy-focused environment where organizations can handle personal data.
