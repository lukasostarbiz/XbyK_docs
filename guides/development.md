Master Xperience by Kentico with our series of guides, covering everything from installing specific versions using .NET CLI to creating and managing reusable content types and designing page templates with Page Builder widgets and sections for structured content display. Learn how to implement data protection and activity tracking or make your website channels support multiple languages.
Each guide is standalone and you can explore them in any order you prefer. If you are interested in a specific topic, simply pick it from the list below. The guide explains the topic and contains code samples that demonstrate the implementation, making it easy to understand and apply what you know.
However, there is a hidden path from zero to hero. We have grouped the guides into a sequence, allowing you to build your knowledge.
Create your first simple Xperience website following steps of our [Kickstart series](guides/development#developer-kickstart).
Starting from the [Page Builder](guides/development#page-builder), you can learn the concepts and code along, gradually building a tiny Training Guides application. The code for this application is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-training-guides), so you can refer to it and ensure you are on the right track as you develop your skills.
