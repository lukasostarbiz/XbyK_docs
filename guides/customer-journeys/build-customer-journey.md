If you’re a marketer juggling multiple priorities, it can be tough to know whether your website content is doing its job. Stop guessing and finally understand how visitors interact with your business. The **Customer journeys** application in Xperience by Kentico help you uncover how visitors move through your site, where they drop off, and what leads them to convert.
A **customer journey** is a series of touch points (called **stages** in Xperience) that show how a visitor progresses toward a specific goal, such as submitting a form, reading a case study, or requesting a product demo.
