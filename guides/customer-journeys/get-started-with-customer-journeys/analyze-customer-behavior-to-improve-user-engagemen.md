Features described on this page require the Xperience by Kentico **Advanced** license tier. 
Keen to find the key to unlocking better engagement and higher conversions? Understanding customer behavior is a vital part of the puzzle. Create and refine your **customer journeys** , clarify how customers interact with your brand, and use the insights to improve their overall experience. Everybody wins.
Let’s have a look at three common scenarios from a marketer’s perspective.
## Three scenarios, one solution
### Use case 1: The unconfirmed registration dilemma
Emma, an experienced marketing manager, notices a pattern – many customers fill out a sign-up form to start a membership program but never confirm their registration. Despite submitting their contact details, users often fail to click the confirmation link in the follow-up email.
Using _Customer journeys_ , Emma maps out the journey **from form submission** to **email engagement** and identifies this key drop-off point. With these insights, she creates a new automation that triggers a **reminder email** after 24 hours, followed by a persuasive message with a **testimonial from a satisfied user**.
As a result, **registration completion rates increase significantly** , and Emma can directly tie journey mapping to improved campaign performance.
### Use case 2: The content engagement puzzle
Darcy, a content marketer for a B2B SaaS company, spends countless sleepless nights creating in-depth whitepapers and blog posts, yet website analytics show that users read one article or download a whitepaper, but then leave the website.
After a quick internal test with several colleagues, Darcy realizes that customers fail to take the next steps due to **unclear CTAs**. He optimizes the content layout with numbered headings, leading the user step-by-step through the content up to conversion, resulting in **increased demo requests**.
### Use case 3: The email click-through rate mystery
Lizzy, a marketing automation specialist, struggles with declining click-through rates despite segmenting her audience and personalizing subject lines.
After creating her customer journey, she notices a drop-off at the email click stage – something she hadn’t been able to pinpoint before. To understand why, she sends out a quick email feedback poll asking recipients what would make them more likely to click. The responses reveal that emails are being sent at **suboptimal times** and that customers prefer more **engaging email copy** with **simple but clear email design**. She adjusts the timing of the emails, her email copy as well as the design, leading to a **boost in engagement and conversions**.
Each of these scenarios highlights a **real-world challenge** marketers face when optimizing their strategies. In this series, we’ll explore **key concepts** underpinning customer journey mapping to better understand why such issues occur, and how to solve them.
**Data overload and actionability:** Much like Darcy – who experinces solid traffic on his website, but also confusingly high dropoff rates – marketers often struggle to make sense of vast amounts of sometimes contradictory customer data, which leads to missed opportunities. Be like Darcy, and pinpoint the cause of such drop off by a focused customer journey graph.
**Understanding customer behavior:** Refine your marketing strategies by getting to know your customers and how they interact with content and products.
**Personalization and engagement:** Creating a customer journey allows you to deliver relevant content for each stage of their journey.
**Marketing ROI and attribution:** Stop puzzling over which touchpoint from hundreds of customer interactions leads to final conversion, and start mapping it out.
