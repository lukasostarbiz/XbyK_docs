# Delete a workflow and workflow steps
Workflows and steps cannot be deleted when there are existing items in the workflow steps, including the **Draft** status. Only items that have the workflow applied are considered, excluding items that were in the **Draft** step when the workflow was assigned to their content type.
If a workflow is removed from the content type (scope), items in the workflow editing cycle keep their current workflow with custom steps until they reach the **Published** step. If a new editing cycle starts (new item or new version of a published item), the default workflow with only **Draft/Published/Unpublished** statuses is used.
