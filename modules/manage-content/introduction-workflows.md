You’ve already learned how to add content to Xperience and display it in a website channel. You’ve also seen how to set up content in different languages. Now, with **workflows** in Xperience by Kentico, you can take control of the publishing process — defining exactly how content is reviewed, approved, and published, so nothing goes live before it’s ready.
In this section, you’ll:
  * Learn what a content workflow is and how it shapes the life cycle of pages, emails, and other content types.
  * See how workflows help you build a content review process that fits your team — whether it’s just you and an editor or a whole chain of approvals.
  * Create a custom workflow step-by-step to match your publishing process.
  * Define the scope of a workflow to decide what content it applies to.
  * Delete workflow steps you no longer need, keeping your process clean and flexible.


By the end of this section, you’ll have the tools to make sure the right people see — and approve — content before it goes live.
