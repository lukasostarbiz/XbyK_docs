As your content library grows, finding the right piece of content – and making sure your audience sees it at the right time – becomes more challenging. That’s where taxonomies come in.
In Xperience by Kentico, taxonomies help you organize, tag, and categorize your content to make it easier to manage and more powerful to use. Whether you’re supporting website navigation, filtering product listings, or delivering personalized experiences, taxonomies give your team the structure to stay in control.
In this module, you’ll learn how to:
  * Understand what taxonomies are and how they support marketing and content goals.
  * Create and configure taxonomies in Xperience by Kentico.
  * Use taxonomies in the Kbank demo site to tag and organize content.
  * Explore different approaches to taxonomies in content modeling.
  * Apply taxonomies to enable personalized experiences for your visitors.


By the end of this module, you’ll be ready to confidently work with taxonomies to improve content structure, discoverability, and marketing impact – all without getting lost in technical details.
