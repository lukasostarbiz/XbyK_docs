# Manage visitor data
Knowing how your visitors navigate and what content they consume through your digital content brings you invaluable insights for defining and optimizing your customer journeys.
Xperience’s _Contact activity tracking_ feature allows you to **track and analyze** how contacts engage with your website, including **browsing patterns** , **content consumption** , **form submissions** , **downloads** , and other activities.
Xperience tracks contacts **based on a cookie**. Once the contact agrees with the tracking, Xperience will always try to **match and log all activities** done by a specific contact, even when the contact performs the activity on a different device (such as visiting the website on their desktop and mobile phone).
Depending on a cookie that represents a current contact, Xperience doesn’t require any further unique identification, such as a contact’s email. As a result, the system can log the activities of **“anonymous” visitors** and identify them later, for example, **when they share their email addresses** with you via a **form**.
You can view the collected contact data in the **Contact management** application. Xperience displays all activities on the website in the **Activities** section. When opening individual contacts, you can see you can see their activities.
With the Xperience **Cross-site tracking** feature, you generate an Xperience tracking script, insert it into your third-party website - and you can start collecting your website’s visitor data, even on websites that haven’t been built with Xperience. Creating an overall **picture of your customer’s interactions in one system** opens new opportunities to personalize your marketing experience.

## Data protection and GDPR
The [Data protection](/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection) functionality helps you **stay within the legal boundaries** of different data protection regulations in marketing-related actions. **Developers can prepare data protection** on your website in different ways. Usually, Xperience will use the contact’s email address as a unique identifier.

## Exercise - Tracking a contact in Xperience
This exercise will give you hands-on experience with the contact tracking feature. You’ll impersonate a website visitor using an incognito window, private window, or another browser and see how Xperience by Kentico collects visitor data in the **Contact management** application.
**Task** :
  1. Open the **Contact management** application in the Xperience administration in one window and your live site in a second, incognito window. (You can copy the whole application URL, open a new incognito window tab, paste in the URL, and remove everything starting from /_admin_ / to the end. Your adjusted URL with only a website homepage URL will look like this, for example, _https://us-03.kenticolab.com/Hosted_Kbank_12345_ .)
  2. In the incognito window, consent to tracking using the **Accept all** button in the consent banner.
  3. Switch to the Xperience administration and go to the **Contacts** tab to refresh your contact list in the **Contact management** application.
  4. Select the **Created** column header in the contacts list to reorder your existing contacts from newest to oldest.
  5. Select the newest contact. This new contact’s name is _Anonymous - (timestamp)_ ; for example, _Anonymous - 2022-08-23 04:45:06.775_.
  6. Use the **Activities** button below the contact’s **Overview** to see the list of activities the contact has performed on the website.
  7. Perform some activities in the incognito window for your contact. Here are some examples: Visit the _News_ listing page, the _Want more space?_ article, and _Loans_ page, and submit a form on the _Contact_ page.
    1. Switch between the live site in the incognito window and the administration while performing these activities. See the **Overview** in your contact’s profile. Then, go back to the **Activities** tab to view the collected data. Watch how Xperience tracks activities in real time.
  8. When you finish browsing your website in the incognito window, switch to the contact’s **Overview** tab. If you have submitted the form on the _Contact_ page, your demo contact will no longer be anonymous.
