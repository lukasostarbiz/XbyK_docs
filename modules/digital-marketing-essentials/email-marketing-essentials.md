Email marketing can promote your services or products and help you stay in touch with your customers. Xperience allows you to create the following types of emails:
  * **Regular** emails for subscribed recipients.
  * **Form autoresponders** are sent automatically after a visitor submits a form.
  * **Confirmation** emails that notify recipients when they successfully subscribe or unsubscribe from email marketing.

## Exercise - Sending a newsletter to a recipient list
In this exercise, you’ll see how you can prepare a newsletter email and send it to a newsletter recipient list.

You want to advertise your financing solutions for small businesses to your newsletter subscribers. Create an email informing your recipients about the advantages of a loan for small businesses.
### Create the email

  2. Create a **New email**.
  3. Fill in: 
    1. **Email name** : _SMB loan newsletter_.
    2. **Email purpose** : _Regular_.
    3. **Content type** : _Simple email_.
    4. Select **Continue**.

  3. Highlight the _Find out more_ , **Insert link** , and choose the **Page** option. 1. Select the _Campaign pages_ in the content tree and _SMB loan campaign_ from the available pages. If you cannot find the page, switch to **Business Banking** in the drop-down menu above the content tree. 2. **Insert** the chosen page.
  4. **Save** the email.
  5. Switch to the **Properties** tab on the right and fill in: 
    1. **Code name** : _SMBLoanNewsletter_.
    2. **Sender** : _Mike_.
    3. **Send to** : _Newsletter recipient list_.
    4. **Save** the changes.


Once the newsletter is ready, you can see what it looks like in the **Preview** tab.
### Sending your email
If you are happy with the email, you can **Review and send** the email. You can schedule the time to send it or send it immediately.
The _Kbank demo website_ is not connected to any SMTP server, so your test email will be marked as **being sent** , but the hosted training environment **will not send** your email to any real-life email address.
