You’ve reached the end of the **Members** module, with flexible widgets that allow your editors to design your site’s member experience, member-contact mapping, editable member profiles, and restricted content.
The examples in this series centered around forms authentication, but you can find information about **External authentication** [here](documentation/developers-and-admins/development/registration-and-authentication/external-authentication).
The [finished branch](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-training-guides/tree/finished) of the _Training guides_ repository contains extra functionality not covered in the series, such as _password reset_ functionality with email confirmation, and a sign-out widget.
To see simpler examples of registration and authentication, which use standard MVC routed views for membership functionality instead of widgets, check out the following examples:
  * The [Xperience by Kentico Community Portal](https://github.com/Kentico/community-portal/tree/e7c0d98cf533899ec79f7a1389bf280b54dbddd2/src/Kentico.Community.Portal.Web/Features/Registration) on GitHub.
  * The **Dancing Goat** sample project, available through the `Kentico.Xperience.Templates` _.NET Templates_ package.
