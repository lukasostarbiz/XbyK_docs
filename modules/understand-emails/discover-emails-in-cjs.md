# Emails and customer journeys
Let’s be honest – email is still one of your most reliable ways to reach people directly. But its power isn’t just in what you send; it’s in what your contacts **do** next.
Every email interaction is a _touchpoint_ : a small but revealing moment in a contact’s decision-making process. Did the contact receive the email? Click through? Ignore it? These actions (or inactions) tell you something valuable about the contact’s **intent and readiness**. And when you plug that behavior into a customer journey, you can stop reacting to behavior and start predicting it instead.
In that way, every moment becomes a meaningful signal in the context of a customer journey:
  * A contact **confirming they want to stay subscribed** might mean that they’re still paying attention to your content, allowing you to engage them further and help them discover their latent need for your services.
  * They **click through a specific product link** – they’re curious, and you can use that to serve them more products as solutions to their needs.
  * They **register for a webinar** – now they’re hooked and open to trying if your solution is the best for them.
  * They **unsubscribe from specific email channels** – something’s not working; perhaps there’s a UX issue, or more likely a content issue you don’t know about.


These are your clues that can turn your email campaigns from isolated broadcasts into connected signals. It’s no longer just “we sent an email”.
It becomes: In the journey, **we see that the contact clicked the link in the product teaser**. Let’s see if they are **ready to follow up with a product whitepaper**.
Instead of guessing who’s ready for the next step, you can let the contacts’ email behavior help you decide.
That shift in thinking opens the door to smarter campaigns, tailored timing, and a clearer picture of what’s working.
