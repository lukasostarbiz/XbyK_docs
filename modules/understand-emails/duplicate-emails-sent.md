# Duplicate emails sent
Seeing the same user receive an email multiple times isn’t just a nuisance. It can erode trust and increase unsubscribes. Recipients may think you’re spamming them or that something is wrong with your system. This often happens with automated emails tied to triggers like form submissions or workflow steps.
#### What you’ll see
One recipient appears in your “Sent emails” count multiple times, or reports receiving the same email more than once.
#### What this means
The email may have been triggered more than once, for example, by users submitting the same form twice or by a customer journey rule that doesn’t properly limit re-entry.
#### How to respond
  * **Review form behavior.** Check for duplicate form submissions or misconfigured confirmations that might fire an email each time.
  * **Audit your email logic.** If using conditions in an [email automation](/guides/digital-marketing/work-with-email/create-email-automation) or in a customer journey, double-check that your email send actions only run once per contact by setting the **Process recurrence** to _If not already running_ , unless recording a contact multiple times is intentional.
