# Compare structure and Email Builder emails
Let’s compare the two approaches across different criteria. This side-by-side table can help you quickly **assess which method better suits your marketing email strategy**.
However, feel free to take an individual approach where you see fit. The rules aren’t set in stone, and what might work for you may be a specific case outside the scope of this material.
In short, don’t be afraid to try out both email types for different scenarios, especially if you have already downloaded your Kbank demo website and are ready to experiment.
Feature |  Structured email |  Email Builder  
---|---|---  
Editing experience |  Form-based (structured content types) |  Visual editor with drag-and-drop widgets and customizable sections  
Layout control |  None (handled by a template prepared by developers) |  Medium (customizable within widget, sections and template properties)  
Speed of authoring |  Very fast |  Medium (setup and layout require more time)  
Personalization by persona |  Not supported |  Partially supported (contact group-based widget variants)  
Design consistency |  Guaranteed by developer templates |  Enforced through developer-defined widget restrictions  
AI (Xperience [AIRA](/documentation/business-users/aira) integration) |  Supported (text summarization, enhancement, and generation) |  Not currently supported  
Ideal use case |  Recurring, simple emails with fixed layout where the focus on content is key |  Emails where layout flexibility or audience-specific content is needed
