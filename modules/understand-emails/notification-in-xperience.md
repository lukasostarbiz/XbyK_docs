# Notifications
It’s easy to confuse notifications with marketing emails, but they’re totally different.
Notifications are internal system emails that alert your team when something happens like a new form submission or a system error. They’re not sent to customers, and they’re not part of your email marketing.
_Example_ : When a customer requests a business loan quote, a notification email alerts the sales team so they can follow up quickly. The email can contain all the data that the customer provided through the online form.
