Module: Understand emails in Xperience
23 of 31 Pages
# Identify email issues
Once your tracking is in place and you understand which metrics truly matter, it’s time to **dig into the patterns**. Your email statistics can quickly show where things are going well and where there’s room for improvement. Each section below highlights a familiar problem marketers face, how it shows up in your stats, and practical ways to fix it using tools available in _Xperience by Kentico_.
### 1. Low click-through rate
**Click-through rate (CTR)** shows how many people clicked a link in your email compared to how many received it. It’s one of the most reliable signs of engagement because it reflects action, not just interest. A solid CTR means your message reaches the right people with content that motivates them to explore and engage further.
#### What you’ll see
Few recipients click links in your emails, even if the delivery and open rates look high.
#### What this means
Your content may not motivate users to take the next step. A high delivery with low clicks often signals that people are receiving your emails, but are not interested enough to act. This could be happening due to unclear messaging, weak CTAs, or a mismatch between user expectations and your content.
#### How to respond
  * **Clarify your CTA.** Make sure there’s a single, prominent call-to-action in the email. Tell the reader exactly what to do next and why it matters.
  * **Cut the noise.** Reduce the number of competing links or visual clutter that might distract from your primary goal.
  * **Use personalization.** Tailor the message using personalization features in Xperience. For example, recommending products based on previous behavior, or [tailoring website content](/guides/digital-marketing/xperience-essentials/personalize-website-content-essentials) by creating a [personalized variant of a widget](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/widget-personalization) is an easy, effective win.
  * **Improve subject lines** Sometimes the subject line creates one expectation, but the content doesn’t deliver on it. Try brainstorming different variants with [AIRA](/documentation/business-users/aira#rich-text-editor-refinements) to see what aligns better with your audience’s intent.
