# Emails events in customer journeys
We already established that your email stats aren’t just numbers on a dashboard – they’re signals you can act on. When you use them as **conditions** to define customer journey stages, they become actionable decision points that help guide contacts from one stage to the next.
Maybe a click on a pricing link shows that someone is ready to talk to sales. An unsubscribe right after a campaign could reveal a misstep in messaging. No clicks across the last three campaigns? It could be time to move the contact to an “At-risk” segment.
These aren’t just actions the contact takes, they’re **opportunities** to respond more precisely to what might be happening, and **nudge the contacts back onto the right path**.
With Xperience’s _Customer journeys_ , you can define these rules and let the platform handle the logic.
If someone interacts with your messaging, move them forward and set Xperience to send automated messages. If they stall, consider starting a re-engagement stream, such as sending a targeted message or campaign to contacts who haven’t clicked in a while. While journeys can’t yet shift contacts automatically between groups, you can build a simple segment or automation to reconnect with these contacts manually or on a set schedule.
That way, you’re still creating a **responsive journey** that adapts to each contact’s behavior, even if every step isn’t fully automated yet.
Here are a few examples of how to set up stage transitions in _Customer journeys_ using email activity:
  * **Clicks that show curiosity:** If a contact clicks a specific product link in an email, move them from “Browsing” stage to “Interested.”
  * **CTA response shows intent:** Clicking a webinar sign-up or pricing link could bump the contact to an “Engaged” stage.
  * **Unsubscription from all emails suggests disengagement:** If the contact unsubscribes from all email interaction, move the contact to “Dormant” or “At-risk” stage.


This approach helps you stay relevant without guessing. A contact who keeps clicking is clearly interested. But if someone hasn’t clicked any of your recent emails, it might be time to rethink your message, or move them to a slower nurture stream.
You’re not working harder. You’re putting the data you already have to work.
