# Spam complaints
Spam complaints are among the most damaging signals your emails can generate. When a recipient marks your message as spam, it sends a direct signal to mailbox providers that your emails are unwanted, or worse, deceptive. A **rising complaint rate harms your sender reputation** and cause future emails to land in the junk folder or be blocked entirely.
#### What you’ll see
You may receive a report from your email provider (such as [SendGrid](/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/email-configuration#sendgrid-integration) ) showing complaints, or you’ll notice a decline in deliverability and engagement without an apparent reason.
#### What this means
Some people might see your emails as off-topic, confusing, or a bit too pushy. This can happen if the subject line isn’t clear, the message feels unexpected, or the recipient doesn’t recognize or trust who it’s from.
#### How to respond
  * **Avoid misleading subject lines.** Make sure your subject line accurately reflects the content of the message.
  * **Set expectations clearly during signup.** Tell users what kind of content they’ll receive and how often.
  * **Make unsubscribing easy.** A visible, **one-click unsubscribe option** is more respectful and effective than hiding it. Xperience by Kentico supports one-click unsubscribe links, but your development team needs to implement them correctly [using our recommended approach](/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/email-builder/develop-email-builder-components#regular-email-unsubscription-links). Unsubscribe links must be easy to find and not obfuscated, or recipients may mark your email as spam instead.
  * **Clean your list of disengaged users.** If someone hasn’t clicked in a long time, they may not want your emails anymore. Removing them can reduce complaint risk.
