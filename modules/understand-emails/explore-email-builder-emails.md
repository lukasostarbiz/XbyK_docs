The _Email Builder_ offers a visual, drag-and-drop experience for creating emails. Similar to Xperience’s **Page Builder** , it lets you put together content using developer-configured **email widgets** inside customizable **email sections**.
[![Email Builder developer-built widgets and customizable sections](docsassets/guides/structured-emails-vs-email-builder/email-builder-widgets-and-sections.png)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/structured-emails-vs-email-builder/email-builder-widgets-and-sections.png)
This approach is perfect if you want more flexibility in how your content looks, whether you’re crafting a one-off blast or tailoring messages for different audiences.
### How does Email Builder work
Unlike [structured emails](modules/understand-emails/understand-structured-emails), where you fill a pre-set form with your content, _Email Builder_ gives you the freedom to build your message visually, using a what-you-see-is-what-you-get approach.
With _Email Builder_ , you can:
  * Build emails by dragging sections and widgets into place.
  * You can see your layout changes as you work.
  * Use widgets that provide editable fields and optional style controls.


### Key benefits of Email Builder
The _Email Builder_ gives you more creative control while keeping developers in the loop through widget restrictions and styling options. But what does that look like in practice?
#### Visual editing experience
You can see your email as you’re building it; no need to preview or guess.
  * You can edit right on the open canvas of the builder and see changes immediately.
  * See what you’re building in real time and make changes on the spot.
  * Great for collaborative work between marketers and designers. Plan your email requirements with your developers, get the widgets built, and then you can take it from there.


#### Styling and layout flexibility
Your developers set up the widgets for you. They can even add styling options so you can adjust the color, size of the text, or the content layout without breaking the brand design guidelines.
  * Developers can make widget styling options (like spacing, fonts, and background colors) available.
  * This gives you more freedom while still staying within approved design rules.
  * It also helps marketing teams quickly prototype and fine-tune layouts.


#### Contact group-based personalization
_Email Builder_ widgets allow you to personalize email content using Contact groups, just like you would in the [Page Builder](documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/widget-personalization).
This means you can tailor sections of your email content to different segments of your audience, without needing to duplicate the entire email, or leave the _Email Builder_ environment.
_Email Builder_ makes it easy to:
  * Show different content to different personas using **Contact groups**.
  * Tailor messages for new customers, loyal subscribers, or re-engagement messaging.
  * This approach is currently supported only in _Email Builder_.
