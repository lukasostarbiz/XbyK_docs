**Unsubscribes** are a regular part of email marketing, but sudden spikes or consistently high numbers signal a deeper problem. When people opt out in large numbers, it’s often because the content isn’t meeting their needs, or they feel overwhelmed by the frequency. Monitoring unsubscribe behavior helps you understand what’s turning people away.
#### What you’ll see
A noticeable number of contacts are unsubscribing after receiving your message.
#### What this means
Something about the message or frequency isn’t sitting right. This could be due to irrelevant content, over-messaging, or a mismatch between what users thought they’d signed up for and what they received.
#### How to respond
  * **Re-align your content with expectations.** Revisit the signup flow or lead magnet that brought people in. Is your content still delivering what they signed up for?
  * **Offer frequency controls.** Consider building a custom email preference center where subscribers choose how often they hear from you, or what types of messaging they want. This reduces frustration and gives users more control.
  * **Segment your audience.** Break your signup flow to populate different recipient lists instead of sending one-size-fits-all emails. You can do this in Xperience by creating a sign-up flow with a dedicated [form](guides/digital-marketing/work-with-forms/forms-application-overview) . In the future, you will also be able to achieve this with our upcoming [recipient targeting feature](https://roadmap.kentico.com/c/321-enhanced-recipient-targeting-for-emails).
  * **Use partially personalized messages.** If you don’t yet have fully dynamic emails, add [personalized email widgets](documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/create-emails-in-email-builder#personalize-widgets) to create email content blocks that speak more directly to a specific segment’s interests or goals.
