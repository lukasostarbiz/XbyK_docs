# When to use Email Builder
The _Email Builder_ is designed for flexibility. If your emails vary in structure, target different audiences, or need more hands-on control over how they look, this is where the _Email Builder_ shines. It’s especially handy when you’re tailoring content to different groups of recipients or simply want to get a more creative editing experience.
Using _Email Builder_ is ideal when you collaborate with designers, use a variety of content formats, or need to customize parts of your emails while staying within brand limits.
Choose the **Email Builder** when:
  * You want a WYSIWYG (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) interface.
  * You plan to send personalized email blasts (e.g., upsells for loyal users vs. how-to guides for new ones).
  * Your layout needs vary across your messaging. For example, one week, you may need side-by-side images, and the next, a new hero block.
  * Your emails need to stand out with customized structure and flow.


### Email Builder in a real-life marketing scenario
Imagine you’re launching a multi-day promotional email blitz for your online store. You want to showcase different products and draw attention with tailored hero banners.
The _Email Builder_ lets you mix content types, apply dynamic content for different customer groups, and visually build it all in one place.
