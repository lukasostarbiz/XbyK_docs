# Leverage email data in customer journeys
Email campaigns aren’t just messages you send to achieve marketing goals. They can become stepping stones that guide people on their [**customer journeys**](/guides/customer-journeys/get-started-with-customer-journeys). Every open, click, or unsubscribe is a signal that shows where someone is and what they might need next as they move **from curiosity to conversion**.
Let’s look at how you can connect the dots between your customer’s email activities and the broader customer journey. You’ll learn how to use email data to **track progress** and uncover **what drives your users forward**. That way, you’re not just sending emails but building momentum.
## Shape better experiences with Customer journeys
_Customer journeys_ help you map your contact’s real-world path as they interact with your brand, one [touchpoint](/guides/customer-journeys/anatomy-of-customer-journeys-key-components/stages-touchpoints-guiding-customers-decision) at a time.
Each journey is a **sequence of stages** that represent a contact’s progress toward a **specific goal** , such as filling out a form, attending a webinar, or completing a purchase. You define the stages, and the system tracks contacts’ movement through the stages of the journey. The result? A clear, **funnel-like view** that shows how people move, stall, or drop off on their way to conversion.

Each journey can reflect a **different goal or experience**.
For example, a lead-nurturing journey might follow contacts from first awareness to sales contact, while a customer onboarding journey could focus on activation and retention. You can then leverage the insights into contacts’ behaviour to optimize your content and tailor your approach to fulfill your users’ current needs, no matter the stage of their journey.
Understanding how _customer journeys_ connect to [email statistics](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/track-email-statistics) gives you more than visibility. It gives you leverage that you can use to update your content or strategy to move your contacts forward. If you can see at which touchpoint the contacts are stalling, you can fix the friction points. If you know what nudges the users forward, you can double down.
That means better campaign results, more conversions, and ultimately, more substantial ROI.
