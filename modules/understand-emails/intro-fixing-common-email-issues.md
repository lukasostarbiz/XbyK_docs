# Intro to common email issues
Even well-planned email campaigns can run into troubles. Sometimes it’s a dip in engagement, an increase in unsubscribes, or results that just don’t match your effort. That’s where your [**email statistics**](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/track-email-statistics) come in.
Your email stats are more than just numbers. They’re signals that help you **fine-tune your content, improve targeting, and adjust your timing**. When something’s off, your stats can show you where to look and what to improve.
Let’s look at some of the most common challenges marketers face when they analyze email performance in **Xperience by Kentico** and see what you can do about it.
For each issue, you’ll explore:
  * What should you look for in your stats?
  * What it likely means.
  * What can you do to fix the issue?


Along the way, we’ll offer practical tips to help you create stronger, more relevant email communications. They’ll help you support your marketing goals and allow you to build and retain long-lasting relationships with your users.
## Check your email configuration
Before diving into your stats, make sure everything is set up correctly. If not, the data you’re seeing may be incomplete or misleading.
Prerequisites to tracking accurate email performance in _Xperience:_
  * Only emails sent through a **Emails channel** will generate statistics. Drafts, previews, and test sends won’t.
  * **Email tracking** and **contact activity logging** must be enabled in your system settings. (Ask your administrator or developer to confirm this.)
  * Be aware of the **limitations of open rate tracking** , especially if you’re relying on it to measure success.
