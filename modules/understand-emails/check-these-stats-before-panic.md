Module: Understand emails in Xperience

# Check these before jumping to conclusions
Email statistics in Xperience give you valuable insights, but only if you understand how and when Xperience collects the data. These quick tips will help you avoid common misunderstandings and make you more confident when you dive into your reports.
### Email stats don’t update instantly
Email statistics in Xperience refresh automatically, but not in real time. It can take **up to 30 minutes** for new data to appear, especially after sending an email blast.
If you don’t see expected results right after sending, give it some time or use the **Refresh** button to manually reload the latest data.
### Test sends and drafts don’t count
Xperience collects statistics only for emails sent through email channels. Sent _drafts_ or links clicked in email _previews_ won’t appear in your performance reports.
To confirm your setup is working, send a small live campaign to internal contacts first. You’ll see how your stats populate in a real-life scenario.
### Watch for high bounce or unsubscribe rates
A spike in bounces or unsubscribes often points to issues with contact quality or content relevance. These numbers affect both deliverability and audience trust.
If you see frequent _soft_ or _hard bounces_ , review your contact lists for outdated or invalid emails. For unsubscribes, revisit your _subject lines_ , email _frequency_ , and overall value your emails deliver to your readers.
## Consent affects what you can track
Some metrics – especially contact activities – depend on tracking consent. Without it, you’ll only see anonymous data, which limits personalization and automation options.
Make sure your forms and subscription points clearly request consent for tracking. Even a simple checkbox can help unlock richer insights later.
