# Low engagement
When your delivery rates, click-throughs, and other interactions are all low, it’s a sign that something more systemic is happening. Maybe your list is outdated, your content has gone stale, or your targeting doesn’t align with the audience’s needs. Low engagement is one of the clearest signs that it’s time to rethink your email approach.
#### What you’ll see
Click-through rates and interaction logs are all consistently low for several email blasts.
#### What this means
Your audience may no longer be interested in the content you’re sending, or they may not even be seeing your emails due to poor deliverability or low inbox visibility. Inactive users can drag down your performance and, as a result, damage your sender reputation over time.
#### How to respond
  * **Run a re-engagement campaign.** Try sending a “Still interested?” or “We miss you” message that gives users a chance to confirm their interest.
  * **Start with personalization.** Even basic personalization like adjusting language to reflect the user’s past behavior or tailoring content to known interests, can reignite interest.
  * **Rethink and adjust your user segments.** Consider who your emails are for. Is the messaging still aligned with their current needs or [customer journey stage](/guides/customer-journeys/anatomy-of-customer-journeys-key-components/stages-touchpoints-guiding-customers-decision)?
  * **Remove inactive users.** After repeated attempts to re-engage, it’s best to stop emailing users who haven’t interacted in a long time. Updating your recipient lists to contain only active subscribers helps protect your sender reputation and improves engagement averages.
