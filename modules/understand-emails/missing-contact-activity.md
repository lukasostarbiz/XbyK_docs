# Missing contact activities
Xperience [contact activity tracking](/guides/digital-marketing/activity-tracking/contact-activity-tracking-overview) gives you a deeper view into how individual users interact with your emails. This includes when they click links, subscribe to newsletters, and move through the stages of the connected [customer journey](/guides/customer-journeys/get-started-with-customer-journeys/what-is-a-customer-journey). When that data is missing or incomplete, it becomes harder to personalize follow-ups or measure success of your marketing strategy.
#### What you’ll see
Your email performance stats (clicks, bounces) look normal, but the related contact activity records are empty or inconsistent.
#### What this means
[Contact activity tracking](/guides/digital-marketing/activity-tracking/contact-activity-tracking-overview) may be turned off, misconfigured, or contacts may not have given consent to tracking. In some cases, tracking isn’t available because the contact has turned their privacy settings on or data protection doesn’t allow it.
#### How to respond
  * **Check tracking configuration.** Verify if [contact tracking is enabled](/guides/digital-marketing/activity-tracking/verify-if-contact-tracking-is-enabled), or ask your administrator to confirm that email tracking and contact activity logging are enabled.
  * **Review consent settings.** Xperience logs data only when the contact provides [valid consent](/guides/configuration/data-protection/find-contact-consent-agreements). Review your consent strategy and forms to make sure you’re collecting what you need.
  * **Use anonymous stats if needed.** Even without full activity tracking, anonymous email stats (like overall click-through rates or bounces) can still offer valuable insights at the email level. To track this data, [segment anonymous contacts](/guides/digital-marketing/work-with-contacts/segmenting-anonymous-contacts) that have given consent.
