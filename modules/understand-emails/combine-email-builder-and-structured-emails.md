Combining both email approaches can be a smart choice for many teams. When your email strategy gets more advanced, pairing structured content with _Email Builder_ gives you the best of both worlds.
This hybrid approach balances the **consistency of a ready-made layout** and the **creative freedom of widgets you can experiment with**.
Using structured fields for stable, reusable parts of the email (like headers, legal disclaimers, or product summaries) helps you move fast. Meanwhile, _Email Builder_ lets you personalize or customize parts of the email as needed.
For example:
  * Use **structured content** to provide consistent headers, product blurbs, or legal text.
  * Add **flexible widgets** to personalize content by audience or feature interactive sections.
  * Ask developers to implement an [**advanced widget**](guides/development/page-builder/define-advanced-widget) to get widgets tailored to your needs, but without the need to do more than drop in your content and be ready to send.


This hybrid setup gives you the best of both worlds because you don’t have to choose. Combine the power of both methods and benefit from structured sections with flexible widgets:
  * Speed and consistency from structured fields.
  * Flexibility and dynamic targeting through the _Email Builder_.


While this isn’t fully showcased in our Kbank demo yet, the capability is already [available in Xperience](guides/development/email-marketing/display-structured-content-email-builder), so why not explore its capabilities as your email strategy matures?
