# Gain insights from emails
Once you connect email touchpoints to a journey, you’re no longer just measuring performance but uncovering **behavior patterns** that help you **guide contacts** more effectively.
The journey view lets you see these patterns at a glance. You’ll spot which emails are nudging contacts forward, which ones are creating friction, and where people tend to stall or drop off. With standalone email reports, this kind of visibility is hard to achieve, because only customer journeys put **every interaction in context**.
For example, you might notice that a product promo email generates many clicks, but few contacts move to the next journey stage. That’s a signal to check what happens **after** the click. Is the landing page unclear? Is the follow-up too slow? With journey data, you don’t just see that something happened. Instead, you know what it **led to**.
Once you’ve identified patterns like this, you can start optimizing touchpoints:
  * **If contacts stall after a specific message,** try adjusting the content or tone. A hard-sell email might benefit from a more educational or value-focused approach.
  * **If contacts click but don’t convert,** review your post-click experience. Are they landing where they expected to? Is the next step they should be taking obvious?
  * **If unsubscribes spike during a nurturing series,** rethink your targeting, frequency, or messaging relevance.
  * **If dormant contacts tend to re-engage with newsletters,** build that into a reactivation flow. Use what’s working to draw them back in.


The power here lies in the loop: **insight leads to change, and change can be measured**. Over time, even minor adjustments like tweaking an email subject line or reordering your follow-up messages can lead to more engaged contacts and successful campaigns.
Think of every email in the journey as a signal. When those signals are part of a bigger map, you can respond clearly, not just react. That’s how optimization becomes ongoing and meaningful.
