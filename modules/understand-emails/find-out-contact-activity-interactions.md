# Learn about email interactions
While overall statistics give you a snapshot of email performance, [contact activities](/guides/digital-marketing/xperience-essentials/collect-visitor-data-essentials) help you zoom in and see what individual users did with your message. This view is especially useful if you want to target engaged [recipients](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers#create-recipient-lists), build smarter [segments](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups), trigger follow-up actions in [automation](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation), or improve [customer journeys](/guides/customer-journeys).
To view activities of individual contacts for a specific email, open the email in the [email channel](/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-channel-management) application and switch to the **Contact activities** view in the panel on the right. You’ll see a list of **recipients** who interacted with the **email** with their **activity** , such as a **click**. Xperience displays the exact **link** they clicked in the **Value** column.
Xperience tracks [email click](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/track-email-statistics) activities for contacts who have [consented to tracking](/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/consent-management).
Your project’s consent policy typically controls consents. If someone hasn’t [agreed to be tracked](/guides/digital-marketing/xperience-essentials/manage-visitor-data-essentials#data-protection-and-gdpr), their activity won’t appear in the _Contact activities_. Their clicks will still be counted anonymously in the overall email statistics that serve as an aggregated overview.
If you compare total clicks in the statistics view with individual clicks in Contact activities, don’t be surprised if the numbers don’t match. Anonymous clicks and identified clicks are logged separately.
Once logged, contact activities become powerful data points you can use across the platform. You can [segment your audience](/guides/digital-marketing/work-with-contacts/contact-segmentation-overview) using **Email click** conditions, personalize your digital marketing content on [websites](/guides/digital-marketing/xperience-essentials/personalize-website-content-essentials) or in [emails](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/create-emails-in-email-builder#personalize-widgets) on their behavior, or build [automated processes](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation) that respond when a contact clicks in an email to access something important like a _pricing page_ , _demo registration form_ , or a _product features overview_.
Combine contact activities with [email widgets](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/create-emails-in-email-builder#email-builder-components) to personalize the email content. If someone clicked a specific type of content in the past, you can tailor the following email they receive to show similar or complementary content.
Make sure your forms and subscriptions collect consent for tracking. Without consent, you’ll lose visibility into who’s engaging with your business and miss opportunities to act on those signals.
