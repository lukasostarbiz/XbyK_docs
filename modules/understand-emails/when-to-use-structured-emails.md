# When to use structured emails
**Structured emails** shine in situations where **speed and consistency** are your top priorities. They’re built for repeatable tasks and are ideal when the content follows a predictable structure. You can forget difficult layout decisions, styling worries, or the risk of going off-brand.
If you’re working on emails that don’t need layout flexibility or personalization, and you just want to get the message out, structured emails are likely the best fit.
Choose **structured emails** when:
  * You send repeatable emails like a weekly newsletter or event update.
  * You want to write quickly and avoid layout or design decisions.
  * Your brand requires strict consistency across all messaging, including emails.
  * You want to use **AIRA** to streamline writing or generate content from your prompts.
  * Your email editors are still learning. It’s easier if they can focus on content and not layout.
  * When you want to simplify your email workflow.


### Structued emails in a real-life marketing scenario
Let’s say you’re managing product updates. Every month, you want to notify customers about new features or changes in the existing product.
With structured emails, you just plug in the product name, short description, and link. AIRA helps polish your copy to perfection, and you send the email within minutes, knowing that it matches your brand template.
