Module: Activities and contacts
1 of 9 Pages
# Introduction to activities and contacts
This module takes a detailed look at contacts and their activities in Xperience by Kentico, exploring practical examples.
We’ll explore each of the following processes:
  * Enabling activity tracking
  * Conditionally rendering tracking scripts based on consent
  * Logging custom activities, both from the server side and the client side
  * Conditionally hiding the contents of page builder sections based on consent
  * Logging activities from an external site
  * Adding custom fields to the Contact object


Some of the materials in this module are not exclusive, and may look familiar if you’ve already completed other modules.
### Prerequisites
This module’s hands-on materials require the following:
  * Familiarity with [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/), [Dependency injection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection), and the [MVC pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview).
  * Basic experience using [Page Builder sections](/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/sections-for-page-builder).
  * Familiarity with the concepts of [consents](/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/consent-management) and [data protection](/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection). 
    * Some of the samples require that you have completed the [Data protection series](/guides/development/data-protection)
  * A running instance of Xperience by Kentico, preferably [29.6.1](/documentation/changelog) or higher. 
Some features covered in the Training guides may not work in older versions. 


**Code samples**
You can find a project with completed, working versions of code samples from this module and others in the [finished branch](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-training-guides/tree/finished) of the _Training guides_ repository.
The [main branch](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-training-guides) of the repository provides a starting point to code along with the guides.
The code samples in this guide are for [.NET 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8/overview) only.
They come from a project that uses [implicit using directives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview#implicit-using-directives). You may need to add additional `using` directives to your code if your project does not use this feature.
