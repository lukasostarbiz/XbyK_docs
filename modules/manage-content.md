Welcome! We’re excited to have you here. In this module, we’ll walk you through the essentials of working with content in Xperience by Kentico.
If your daily tasks involve creating new pages, updating existing content, or managing information for different audiences, understanding how content works can make your job much easier. This module is designed to give you a strong foundation — helping you save time, avoid mistakes, and feel more confident every time you work in the system.
Here’s what you’ll be able to do after completing this module:
  * Create and manage different types of content.
  * Set up and reuse content across your site to stay consistent and work more efficiently.
  * Manage multilingual content to better support audiences in different languages.
  * Use workflows to organize, review, and safely publish your work.


By the end, you’ll not only understand how content fits together in Xperience — you’ll also be better equipped to handle your daily tasks faster and with less stress. Plus, you’ll get hands-on practice with the Kbank demo site, so you can apply everything you learn right away.
