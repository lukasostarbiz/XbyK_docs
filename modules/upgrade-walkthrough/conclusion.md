If you’re planning a migration to **Xperience by Kentico** from another solution, the [Kentico Migration Toolkit](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-migration-toolkit) can help you streamline the process and reduce manual effort.
The toolkit is a growing collection of open-source tools maintained by Kentico and designed to support content and data migration from a variety of sources. Each tool is hosted and documented on GitHub, giving you full access to customize or extend them for your project.
Explore the tools:
  * [Sitecore Migration Tool](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-sitecore-migration-tool) – Bring over content from Sitecore.
  * [Sitefinity Migration Tool](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-sitefinity-migration-tool) – Transfer projects from Sitefinity.
  * [Universal Migration Tool](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-universal-migration-tool) – A flexible base for importing from any external data source.


Kentico continues to invest in and expand the toolkit, with regular enhancements aligned to the product roadmap.
