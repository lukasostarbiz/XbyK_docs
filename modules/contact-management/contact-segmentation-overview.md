Contact segmentation in Xperience by Kentico helps you divide your website’s visitors (“contacts” in general) into groups of shared characteristics. Segmenting your contacts based on their behavior, demographics, and interests will help organize your contact database.
As a marketer, you need to constantly smoothen the customer journey, drive engagement, and keep improving customer experience. Segmenting your audience helps you focus on targeting communication and messages to your audience. 
For example, you can group contacts from the same country who showed interest in the same content. Splitting your audience into segments ensures that everyone within this group receives information tailored to their needs and preferences, which leads to higher engagement and improved customer experience.
