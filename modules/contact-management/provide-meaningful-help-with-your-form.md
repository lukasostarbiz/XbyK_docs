# Provide users help with your form
Learn about the tools you can use to guide your visitors through your form to ensure it’s easy to fill in.
Let’s add some hints to the form fields to make your forms more accessible and user-friendly.
  1. Go to the **Forms** application.
  2. Find the form you need to adjust.
  3. Adjust one or more of the field’s properties to ensure you guide your site’s visitors through the form:
    1. Set a **Default value** when it fits the majority of your visitors. The visitor can replace default values with their input.  _You can also fill in personalized default valuesdynamically with custom development**.**_
    2. Use **Explanation text** to provide additional information vital for improving form experience. The Explanation text shows below the field.
    3. Add a brief **Tooltip** to provide additional context. The  _Tooltip_ appears when a visitor interacts with the form. It shouldn’t contain any vital information necessary for submitting the field.
    4. Consider if your fields need a **Placeholder**. Placeholder text is usually displayed in a lighter color in the field and disappears when a visitor interacts with the field.
