See how you can update a form or reuse an old unused one.
  1. Go to the **Forms** application.
  2. Open the form you want to change.
  3. To adjust the field’s properties, use the field’s **Configure** button. Ensure that you guide your site’s visitors through the form and minimize any friction. Assure that:
    1. The **Label** describes the purpose of the field (e.g., _First name_) and lets your visitors know what data they must provide. It may be prefilled by default, depending on your project settings.
    2. The **Required** checkbox let’s you indicate that a field must contain a value before the visitor is allowed to submit the online form. You can find the _Required_ checkbox in the field’s properties.
    3. The **Name** is a unique identifier of the form field. The field’s name is usually prefilled when you create the form.
Changing the name may break the form functionality if the original name is already used within a macro or the website’s code, so only change it if necessary. 
    4. Make sure the **Form name** describes the purpose of the form. You will see the name in the list of forms.
      1. Go to the **General** tab on the right side and change the _Form name_.
    5. The **Code name** serves as a unique identifier of the form, and is usually prefilled. Same as with the form _Name_ , changing it may break the form functionality, so we advise to leave the prefilled value as is.
Do NOT change the **Name** if the form is already in use in your application.
Do NOT change the **Codename** if the form has already been published to the live site.
If you’re unsure whether the names of the form are used anywhere, please, check with your developers.
