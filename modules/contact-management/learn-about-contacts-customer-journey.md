# Track contact activities
See the contact’s activities on your website and learn about the contact’s journey.
If you want to dive deeper and gain a more holistic view of the customer’s behaviour on your website, and want to tailor digital experiences to your customers’ needs, please see our [**Customer journeys**](/guides/customer-journeys) series.
  1. To find out which activities a contact performed, navigate to the **Contact management** application and use the contact’s email address in the search field.
  2. Open the contact profile. You’ll see three recent activities under the contact’s email address on the **Overview** tab.
  3. To find more activities, switch to the contact’s **Activities** tab on the left below the contact’s name.
