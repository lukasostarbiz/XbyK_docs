# Contacts in Xperience
[Contacts](/modules/contact-management/contact-management) in Xperience by Kentico represent people who view and interact with content through channels, e.g., visitors of a website. Each contact stores the visitor’s personal data and other marketing-related information.
**On websites** , contacts cover both anonymous visitors (identified by an HTTP cookie, depending on the [Default cookie level](/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/cookies)) and users who identify themselves by submitting their name, email address and other data. The system automatically [tracks the activities](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-activities) that contacts perform on the website and gathers data about contacts based on the actions and input of the associated visitors.
The collected [contact data](/modules/contact-management/contact-management) allows marketers to analyze client behavior, optimize content, identify potential buyers, and perform other marketing‑related actions.
**Contacts and channels**
Contacts are global and shared across all content [channels](/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management). For example, if you use your Xperience application to run two websites, send messages through an email channel, and deliver content to an external application through a headless channel, visitors and email recipients from all channels will belong to the same pool of contacts.
## Contact tracking requirements
The contact tracking functionality in Xperience is **enabled by default**. However, due to [personal data protection](/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection) policies, contacts are only tracked for website channels with the **Default cookie level** set to _Visitor_ or _All_ , or if visitors give tracking consent and increase their cookie level. For more information, see [Consent development](/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/consent-development).
