You can set up an automation process to log a [custom activity](documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/set-up-activities/custom-activities), which can then trigger another automation process using the logged activity as the trigger.
For example, when a user registers for an event, you can log a custom “Event registration” activity through various channels. Then, an automation process is triggered by the activity, which sends out event-related communications or feedback requests after the event ends.
The initial automation process can include a repeated condition, such as submitting a form or visiting a page, to check if the user progresses further in their registration process. If the user fails to progress in a timely manner, the process can end with a step which logs a custom activity such as “Ignored all reminders after registration and got stuck”. This would trigger a secondary process, which can initiate a re-engagement campaign.
Additionally, custom activities logged by automation processes can be used in [contact group](modules/contact-management/contact-groups) conditions, which enhances [personalization](documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/content-personalization) opportunities.
