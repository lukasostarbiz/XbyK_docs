# Change a form's name
Learn how to adjust a form’s name to follow your own naming conventions.
When you create a new form, it comes with a generated name. However, the form’s name contains a timestamp and can seem confusing and not very informative. With a growing number of forms, you want to be able to find the form you are looking for. It’s a good practice to create your own naming convention so you can find your form with a quick glance at the form list.
  1. Navigate to the **Forms** application.
  2. Go to the form’s **General** tab on the right side.
  3. Change: 
    1. **Display name** : e.g., _Contact us,_
    2. **Code name** : e.g., _ContactUs_.
  4. **Save** your changes.
