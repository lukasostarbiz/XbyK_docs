# Track contacts on another website
Learn about the possibility to track your visitors even outside your own website.
Xperience’s **Cross-site tracking** feature allows you to track activity and collect data about visitor behavior across multiple websites or domains. You can generate a tracking script and insert it into another website to extend the built-in Xperience contact activity tracking. Your Xperience application will track and store your visitors’ activities and engagement, even when these sites are not built on the Xperience by Kentico platform.
