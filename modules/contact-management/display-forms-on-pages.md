**Prerequisite**
A developer needs to [set up](documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder) Page Builder and prepare pages with editable areas before you can display forms on pages.
On pages where Page Builder is enabled, you can insert [forms](modules/contact-management/create-and-edit-forms) via the **Form** widget:
  1. Open a website channel application.
  2. Navigate to a page using the content tree.
  3. [Add](documentation/business-users/website-content/widgets-and-page-builder) a **Form** widget to the desired editable area.
