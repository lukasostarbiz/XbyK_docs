# Update existing contact group
See how you can adjust an existing contact group to match new definition.
Let’s say that you want to personalize the content of you website for contacts collected into a contact group. Just before you launch your campaign, you realize that your contact group definition doesn’t verify if a contact gave you a consent agreement to use this advanced marketing tactic.
The following how-to show you steps to fix your contact group definition.
  1. Go to the **Contact groups** application.
  2. Open the group you want to change.
  3. Select **Edit** in the _Conditions_ field. 
    1. **Add condition group**.
    2. Find the _Contact has agreed with consent_ condition rule.
    3. Select the specific consent from the drop-down list. 
      1. You may want to add several different consents. In such a case, add each consent as a new condition rule using **Add another condition** button.
    4. **Save** your changes.
  4. After you edit the conditions, you must _Recalculate the group_. During recalculation, Xperience checks all the contacts in the database and the group and keeps only those contacts in the group that fulfill the updated requirements. 
    1. Above the group overview, you’ll see a friendly warning informing you about the changes.
    2. Select **Recalculate the group** to reevaluate contacts, and let Xperience will do the work.
