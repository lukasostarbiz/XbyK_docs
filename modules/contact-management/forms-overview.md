While _contact activity tracking_ shows you how visitors behave on your website, **forms** help you take the next step: **gathering direct input** from your visitors, customers, partners, or suppliers.
Using the **Forms** application in Xperience by Kentico, you can create and manage online forms that collect structured data, such as contact details, preferences, or questions about your products or services. You can then use this information to update contact records, personalize content, and trigger automated actions.
In this section, you’ll learn how to:
  * Build simple forms, like a _Contact Us_ form, to let visitors reach out or request information.
  * Display custom “Thank you” messages after submissions to enhance the user experience.
  * Set up forms to trigger next steps automatically, like sending autoresponder emails or subscribing contacts to a newsletter.
  * Customize form fields to gather the data your business needs most.


Forms aren’t just about data collection. They’re a valuable touchpoint in your digital experience, helping you connect more meaningfully with your audience.
