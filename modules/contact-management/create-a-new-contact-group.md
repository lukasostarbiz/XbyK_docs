# Create a new contact group
See how to create a new group of contacts and how to work with group conditions.
  1. Go to the **Contact groups** application.
  2. Create a **New contact group**.
  3. Add a **Name** of the group. We recommend using clear, concise, and descriptive names to identify the segment among other groups in the administration interface.
  4. Add a **Code name**. This serves as a unique identifier used in macros.
  5. Add a short **Description** so everybody on the team knows the group’s purpose.
  6. Use **Add condition** button to create condition rules. Xperience adds all contacts that match the conditions to the contact group.


Xperience allows you to create contact groups using complex sets of conditions. You can organize these rules into units and determine these groups’ relationships. That’s why we recommend - for more complex filtering scenarios - to specify the conditions “on paper” before you start defining them in Xperience.
You can choose between **Add another condition** or **Add another group** when creating your conditions.
  * If you choose to **Add another condition** to existing conditions, you create a single unit of conditions where all rules are evaluated together. 
    * For example (Unit 1): _Contact is from country: USA_ AND _Contact has submitted a form: Loan Form_.
  * If you **Add another group** of conditions, you create a new unit. 
    * For example (Unit 2): _Contact is from country: Australia_ AND _Contact has submitted a form: Mortgage application_.
    * Xperience allows you also to evaluate the relationship between units using logical operators AND or OR. 
      * For example, see the logical operator OR between unit 1 and unit 2. Thanks to the OR operator, contact will be included in the group when either of these units is evaluated as true.
