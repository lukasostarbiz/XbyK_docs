While _contacts_ help you understand all your visitors – whether known or anonymous – some visitors go a step further and create an account on your site. These registered visitors are known as _members_.
In this short section, you’ll learn how to use the **Members** application to manage these accounts – viewing, editing, disabling, or deleting member profiles as needed. It’s a helpful tool for websites that offer personalized content for signed-in users.
