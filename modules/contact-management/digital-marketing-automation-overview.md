Now that you know how to manage your contacts and members, it’s time to explore how to interact with them – automatically and at scale.
In this final section, you’ll learn how to use **Automation** in **Xperience by Kentico** to create flexible, step-by-step processes that respond to visitor actions.
Follow along and learn how to set up automation processes for scenarios such as:
  * Sending personalized follow-up emails after a form submission.
  * Welcoming new members right after they register.
  * Waiting between steps to give users time to act.
  * Using conditions to tailor the journey based on visitor behavior.
