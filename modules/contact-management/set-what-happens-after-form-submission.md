Set up an automated response after a visitor submits your online form.
In the example scenario on this page, we will be working in our hosted demo website – **Kbank**. You can request a demo instance using the [form at kentico.com.](https://www.kentico.com/services/training/training-website-requests)
Select **Xperience by Kentico – Business Tutorial Kbank** as your demo site option. You’ll get access to a sandbox environment where you can explore features and test your ideas freely.
  1. Locate your form on a page in a website channel. In our case, we’ll be working in the **Personal Banking** channel on Kbank.
  2. Open the page for edits with the **Edit page** button and navigate to the widget that contains your form.
  3. Use the **Configure section** button (
  4. To trigger an automated response after submitting the form, choose what you want to happen in the **After form submission** section: 
    1. **Display a message** - displays this message directly on the page after the visitor has submitted a form.
    2. **Redirect to URL** - redirects the contact to a specific URL.
    3. **Redirect to page** - redirects the contact to a selected Xperience page.

  5. Save and publish your changes.
  6. If you also wish to set up an automated email (**Autoresponder**) the visitor receives after the form submission, switch to the **Forms** app. 
    1. Go to your form and open the **Autoresponder** view on the right side of the form editor window.
    2. Choose an existing autoresponder email from the drop-down menu under _Select email_ or add a _Custom_ email that your developer prepared.
