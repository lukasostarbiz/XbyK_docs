# Consider content personalization
Xperience comes with a powerful segmentation tool called contact groups.
You can break down your audience into segments based on their shared characteristics, such as the same demographic information, like age or location, or interests, for example, consuming the same content on your website. You can then accurately target different contact groups with tailored content on the same page to improve your marketing efforts. Find out more about [contact groups](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-groups) in the documentation.
Not all widgets have to support content personalization. Save time and implementation costs, look into your customer journey and the touch-points you want to define on your website and define only the necessary content components that support content personalization in the project requirements.
## Simplify content creation to help your marketing team
The way you break down editing experience page components needs to fit your team’s experience.
  1. **Leverage Your Expertise** : Draw upon your team’s experience and help developers and business analysts define the components. Your team insights are invaluable in shaping practical page components - and representatives (or stakeholders) from content editing must be part of the content modeling sessions.
  2. **Validate Continuously** : Regularly assess and validate your chosen components and approach. Every developer working on the presentation layer should try creating several pages before inviting editors. Gather the feedback from test sessions and implement changes to optimize every component.
  3. **Prioritize Best Practices** : Every page should be built with a page template so that editors can save their preferred configuration. Follow this principle. At the same time, apply your knowledge of responsive design to ensure page templates work correctly and set up restrictions on components to ensure the page’s accessibility. Add explanations and instructions to help editors quickly understand what each property serves and what data is expected of them. (See the green explanations in screenshots above.)
  4. **Iterate Thoughtfully** : Defining the presentation model (as well as the whole content modeling) is an iterative process. Refine and enhance templates and other Page Builder components based on real-world usage and user needs.


## Page components in a nutshell
Align the presentation layer with your content strategy to help editors tailor the customer experience and guide them toward their intended actions. When you understand your marketing goals and know what common data types you’ll be working with, you can define the components your team will use to effectively display the content on the website channels.
The Kentico’s Page Builder will help your team create dynamic, personalized pages that resonate with your target audience. At the same time, your content will be stored in a way that makes reuse and content curation easier.
