You’ve reached the end of this module on structuring the presentation layer in Xperience by Kentico. In this module, you explored how to design and model the key components of a website’s layout in a way that supports both long-term maintainability and a smooth editorial workflow.
You learned how to define and organize presentation elements – such as headers, footers, and reusable layout structures – that support a consistent visual design. You saw how to model Page Builder sections and widgets to give editors flexible yet guided tools for building pages, while maintaining alignment with your content strategy.
Throughout the module, you focused on key architectural principles, including:
  * Streamlining the editor experience by providing clear, reusable components that reduce guesswork and promote consistency.
  * Supporting reusability and scalability by creating modular structures that can be used across pages, templates, and campaigns – saving time and effort.
  * Maintaining design consistency through structured layout elements that enforce standards while still offering flexibility where needed.
  * Aligning content and presentation so that the structure of your site reflects the meaning of the content–not just its appearance.
  * Improving long-term maintainability by building a clear, modular architecture that’s easier to update and extend without risking layout issues.


By mastering these concepts, you’re now better equipped to design a presentation layer that serves both development and content team – scalable, flexible, and ready to evolve as your project grows.
