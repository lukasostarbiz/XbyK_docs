# Taxonomies in general
You can model taxonomies in Xperience using one of the following ways
  * **Controlled Vocabulary** – A _controlled vocabulary_ is the simplest taxonomy type. Editor teams define specific words or terms that represent topics shared across different content pieces and agree to use only these terms to describe categories of topics within their digital content.
  * **Hierarchical taxonomy** – This taxonomy type enables you to establish hierarchies between tags and show their relationships. Hierarchical taxonomies help your team structure complex content, allowing you to create logical parent-child relationships between topics. This enhances content organization and user navigation, especially in large content sets.


In Xperience, you can build _controlled vocabularies_ and _hierarchical taxonomies_ , which offers your team greater flexibility when organizing your digital content.
### Other taxonomy types
Xperience doesn’t support advanced taxonomies such as [semantic networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_network) or [ontologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_\(information_science\)). These more sophisticated taxonomies often require specialized systems that can model relationships and provide an easy-to-navigate way through the classification schemes.
For more information on taxonomies and how to define them, take a look at [The Accidental Taxonomist](https://www.hedden-information.com/accidental-taxonomist/) by Heather Hedden. This book categorizes taxonomies into the types discussed above.
