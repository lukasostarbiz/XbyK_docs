**Code samples**
You can find a project with completed, working versions of code samples from this guide and others in the [finished branch](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-training-guides/tree/finished) of the _Training guides_ repository.
The [**main branch**](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-training-guides) of the repository provides a **starting point** to code along with this module.
The code samples in this module have only been tested in [.NET 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/overview).
They come from a project that uses [implicit using directives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview#implicit-using-directives). You may need to add additional `using` directives to your code if your project does not use this feature.
