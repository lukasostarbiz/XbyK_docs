# Data protection overview
Now that you know how to set up users and assign the right roles and permissions, it’s time to focus on protecting the personal data your team may access through their daily work.
In this section, you’ll learn how the **Data Protection** application in **Xperience by Kentico** helps organizations comply with data protection and privacy regulations, such as the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) in the European Union. Once prepared by the developers, it helps manage and protect personal data collected and processed within the Xperience application. Xperience provides a unified interface you can use to:
  * Manage your clients’ consent regarding their personal data.
  * Handle their requests to access or remove their data.
  * Anonymize and encrypt their data to prevent unauthorized access.


Data protection is more than a legal requirement – it’s an important part of building trust with your customers.
