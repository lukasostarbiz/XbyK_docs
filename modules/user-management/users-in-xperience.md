[![](/docsassets/guides/work-with-users-essentials/Users-icon.png)](/docsassets/guides/work-with-users-essentials/Users-icon.png)
Users represent individual user accounts that can be accessed in the system with their own credentials. Anytime a user reaches out that they need to change something in their profile or a team lead wants you to add a new team member to your Xperience application, follow along to find your way around the Xperience **Users** application.
## How to create or edit a user
To create a new user, you must have Xperience configured to send transactional emails. 
  1. Go to the **Users** application.
  2. Select **New user** , fill in their information, and **save** the changes.
     * When you create a new user, Xperience sends them a confirmation email with a link to create their password.
  3. You can change other users’ credentials as an _administrator_ with appropriate permissions. Find the user in the **Users** application and update their profile.
  4. Change the user’s general information and **roles** , or activate or deactivate the user.
