## Emma’s dilemma solved: unconfirmed registrations completed with customer journeys
Emma’s earlier challenge with [unconfirmed registrations](/modules/customer-journeys/analyze-customer-behavior-to-improve-user-engagemen) clearly shows how _Customer journeys_ can deliver practical value.
By identifying **at which stage** of their customer journey users **dropped off** – right after submitting a form but before confirming their registration – Emma was able to refine her team’s communication strategy. Customer journey helped her implement timely reminders and more compelling messaging, ultimately driving higher registration confirmation rates.
This use case demonstrates how customer journeys uncover actionable insights that drive business success.
If you’re still deciding whether _Customer journeys_ are the right solution for your business, let’s review a few arguments in favor and against this feature.
## Pros of customer journeys
**Improved customer insights:** A deeper understanding of customer behavior and needs helps businesses anticipate needs, refine messaging, and identify bottlenecks that hinder conversions.
**Optimized marketing strategies:** By leveraging data-driven insights, marketers can tailor more relevant and effective campaigns. Once your team understands where customers drop off or engage most, they can allocate resources wisely, improving ROI and campaign performance.
**Increased customer satisfaction:** Addressing pain points proactively enhances user experience; well-catered customers are more likely to stay engaged, convert, and become loyal brand advocates.
## Cons of customer journeys
**Time-consuming process:** Creating customer journeys requires significant effort and resources. It involves gathering and analyzing large amounts of data, which can be a slow process, especially without automation.
**Data silos and integration challenges:** Customer data often resides in different systems, making it challenging to gather relevant insights that will help your team create a unified journey map. Aligning marketing, sales, and customer service data is crucial, but can be complex without the right tools.
