# Campaigns - driving success
**Advanced license required**   
  
Features described on this page require the Xperience by Kentico **Advanced** license tier. 
Marketing campaigns don’t just create noise – they create movement. They help prospects take meaningful steps forward in their decision-making process. That’s why campaigns are more than just isolated marketing activities – they are the engine **powering progression of a customer along the customer journey**.
While our **Customer journeys** feature is designed to provide strategic visibility into how customers move across touchpoints, the upcoming **Campaigns** feature will bring **tactical execution to that vision**. Together, they’ll form a powerful toolkit for modern marketers – helping you understand intent, respond to needs, and drive conversions at every stage of the journey.
## Marketing automation meets journey mapping
What is the role of campaigns in accelerating the customer journey? _Customer journeys_ give you the **map** , and **report the position** of real-life customers represented by contacts, marketing campaigns give you the **vehicle** to help them travel that road.
Make sure that campaign-driven activities are accurately recorded in contact profiles within Xperience by Kentico, using either built-in or custom activity types.
The campaigns feature acts as a dynamic companion to journey mapping by **turning insights into action**. Marketers can use the insights to run marketing campaigns with **targeted content, personalized offers, and timely messaging across channels** – all informed by the customer’s current journey stage.
For example, if your journey map shows a large volume of contacts stalling in the consideration stage, with campaigns you can deploy an email series, launch a remarketing ad, or trigger a webinar invitation – all tailored to re-engage those contacts and encourage the next step forward.
## Use campaigns to improve drop-off rate
You may have heard: “Not every lead is ready to buy – but every lead can be nurtured.”
Then comes the dilemma – is the customer on the cusp of turning from an MQL to an SQL, or are they still at the beginning of their journey, thinking things over as prospects? _Customer journeys_ give you the insight into how far down their journey is the customer located, and possibly when is the best timing to excite their appetite.
Your targeted campaign will then build on the insights provided by a well-detailed journey, and give marketers the tools to **meet prospects where they are** , rather than where we want them to be. Whether it’s a soft-touch brand awareness email, or a more direct product comparison download, campaigns deliver the right content at the right time.
When used strategically, campaigns can:
  * Warm up cold leads with helpful content
  * Re-engage previously inactive contacts
  * Move MQLs toward SQL qualification with tailored CTAs
  * Support sales with automated follow-up sequences


This turns content delivery into more than just communication – it becomes a conversion mechanism closely aligned with the customer journey’s progression.
## Connecting campaigns with journey phases
There is a strategic overlap between journey mapping and campaign execution. The most effective campaigns aren’t created in isolation – they are **anchored to the mapped customer journey**.
Each stage of the customer journey demands a different type of messaging and engagement. By aligning campaigns to those stages, marketers can ensure a seamless experience for their audience. This is where strategic tagging and tracking – like UTM parameters – become essential.
For example:
  * A **See stage** campaign might focus on top-of-funnel blog content promoted via social ads.
  * A **Think stage** campaign could involve a gated whitepaper download with lead scoring attached.
  * A **Do stage** campaign might include a product demo email sequence.
  * A **Care stage** campaign could revolve around loyalty rewards or onboarding education.


By connecting each campaign and touchpoint accordingly, marketers can see which campaign elements contribute to progression in the journey – and optimize accordingly.
## From awareness to action
Once a contact is identified and mapped in the customer journey, they shouldn’t be left to drift. Check your customer journey and evaluate: “Is the momentum still going?” “Is a contact moving from Prospect to Lead?”, and adapt messages as the customer’s mindset evolves.
A contact moving from “Prospect” to “Lead”? That’s your cue to shift from thought leadership to product positioning. An MQL showing signs of intent? Time for a targeted case study or a time-sensitive webinar invite. A loyal customer slowing down engagement? A reactivation email might bring them back into the fold.
In essence, use insights from your journeys and effectively influence customer decisions. They give marketers a way to not only observe journeys but also to **influence them in real time**.
