# Xperience - integrate data, build seamless journeys
**Advanced license required**   
  
Features described on this page require the Xperience by Kentico **Advanced** license tier. 
A well-orchestrated customer journey doesn’t exist in isolation. It thrives on context – and that context comes from connected data, synchronized tools, and a unified digital marketing ecosystem. That’s exactly what **Xperience by Kentico** enables – a single platform where apps and features work together to deliver meaningful, data-driven customer experiences.
While _Customer journeys_ provides a strategic overview of how contacts move through key phases, the real power comes from how this feature connects with the rest of the platform.
## Connecting Customer journeys with other apps
_Customer journeys_ isn’t a standalone module. It draws upon – and feeds into – core _Xperience_ features. You can dig deeper into each of these by following the links to individual pages. Don’t be intimidated – each page is a standalone text that helps you start with your _Xperience_ faster than you can say “journey mapping”.
### Contact management
The foundation for understanding who your contacts are and how they behave. This app houses key profile data, activity history, and segmentation triggers that feed directly into **Customer journeys**.
[Work with contacts](/guides/digital-marketing/work-with-contacts) – Learn how to manage contacts and contact groups and where to see your contact’s customer journey.
[Manage visitor data](/guides/digital-marketing/xperience-essentials/manage-visitor-data-essentials) – Knowing how your visitors navigate and what content they consume through your digital content brings you invaluable insights for defining and optimizing your customer journeys.
### Contact groups
These dynamic segments help define customer journey entry points, tailor experiences, and measure the journey’s progression. They allow you to group contacts by behavior, characteristics, or lifecycle stage, and then tie that logic to journey actions or outcomes.
Ideally, you want to tie in your **customer segments** with your contact groups, ensuring that each customer is being sent the right pieces of communication at the right stage of their journey.
[Contact groups overview](/guides/digital-marketing/work-with-contacts/contact-groups-overview) – Contact groups in Xperience are segments created from contacts in your database. Learn how to create contact groups and segment your audience.
[Personalize website content](/guides/digital-marketing/xperience-essentials/personalize-website-content-essentials) – Personalization allows you to **custom-tailor the content** for your website visitors.
[Segment your website audience](/guides/digital-marketing/xperience-essentials/segment-your-website-audience-essentials) – Learn how to use the contact’s demographic data, content preferences, or various website activities to shape their digital experience.
### Data protection
Seamless integration with your journey workflows ensures that consent management, data retention, and compliance protocols like GDPR are baked into every interaction – not added as an afterthought.
Together, these features ensure that journeys are informed, compliant, and continuously updated with real user behavior — not static assumptions.
[Data protection](/guides/configuration/data-protection) – See how you can manage personal data or customer consents, and handle customer data and removal requests.
## Dynamic customer journey conditions
To deliver meaningful, personalized experiences, **Customer journeys** need to respond to real-time triggers. That’s where **dynamic conditions** come in.
These conditions allow marketers to create adaptive journeys that react to a contact’s behavior, not just their demographics. The conditions are based on **custom activities** , such as:
  * Contact submitted a form
  * Contact visited a specific page
  * Contact is a member (or has registered as one)
  * Contact clicked an email link (with a specific URL)
  * Contact performed a custom activity with a defined value


This level of flexibility means that journeys aren’t just linear – they’re designed to be **responsive and intelligent** , adapting as customer behavior unfolds. Contacts can enter different branches or stages of the journey depending on what they actually do, not just what we hope they’ll do.
## CRM data synchronization
Seamless integration between Xperience by Kentico and CRM systems ensures that customer interactions are tracked in real time, helping marketing and sales teams work from a unified data set.
With this integration, you can:
  * **Automatically update journey stages** based on CRM data (e.g., when a lead moves from MQL to SQL).
  * **Personalize campaigns** based on deal status, sales interactions, or account ownership.
  * **Bridge the gap between marketing and sales** , ensuring every customer touchpoint is informed by the latest engagement data.


[Xperience by Kentico CRM](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-crm) provides a starter kit for general integration and contains plug-and-play packages for Microsoft Dynamics and Salesforce Sales Cloud – you can fully leverage this integration to enrich your customer journeys with **CRM insights**.
## Filling the gaps between customer journeys, personas, and lead scoring
While **personas** and **lead scoring** are features not yet available in Xperience by Kentico, marketers can still incorporate these concepts using external tools and manual strategies.
### Personas
Without built-in [Persona](https://docs.kentico.com/13/on-line-marketing-features/managing-your-on-line-marketing-features/personas) application, you can approximate persona-driven messaging by:
  * Targeting contacts based on their **membership status** (e.g., registered users vs. anonymous visitors).
  * Using **Contact groups** to segment contacts by behavioral or demographic characteristics – such as country, industry, or campaign response.
  * Tailoring content and campaigns using data available in **Contact management** , such as preferred language, known interests (based on form selections), or referral source.


While these techniques don’t replace full persona modeling, they offer a practical way to deliver more **tailored messaging to meaningful customer segments** – based on data already available in Xperience.
### Lead Scoring
For some clever lead qualification, you can:
  * Track engagement indicators manually using **custom contact properties** (e.g., number of form submissions, specific content viewed).
  * Define thresholds for **behavioral triggers** (e.g., visited pricing page + submitted demo request = high-interest lead).
  * Use integrated **CRM tools** to manage lead scoring externally, and synchronize that scoring data back into Xperience where needed.


As these features are introduced in future releases, you will be able to further refine customer journeys with native support for **persona-based segmentation and automated scoring models** – bringing even more intelligence and precision to your digital marketing strategy.
