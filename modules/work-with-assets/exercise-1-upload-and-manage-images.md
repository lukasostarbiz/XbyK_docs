Imagine that you’re running a flash promotional push to promote a new product – _Family Savings Account_. The promo push will involve a whole batch of images, but uploading them one by one would be slow and a bit frustrating.
That’s why _Content hub_ allows you to **upload and prepare multiple images** at the same time. With some help from _AIRA_ , you’ll also ad the correct tags, and automatically generate image variants in different sizes. By the end, you’ll have a clean, [well-organized folder of assets](guides/digital-marketing/work-with-reusable-content/organize-assets-in-content-hub#create-folder-hierarchy) ready to be used across your promo push.
To follow along with the exercise, download a [zipped file of 11 images](https://download.kentico.com/Training/sample+assets_multifile_upload.zip) we prepared for you.
  1. **Download and prepare your images**
    1. Download the sample images ZIP from the course resources and extract it to a local folder on your device.
    2. Review the file names and remove duplicates if necessary to keep the library clean.


If your team has a file-naming convention, rename files to ensure consistency with internal rules.
  1. **Open Content hub and choose your target folder**
    1. In Xperience, go to **Content management** and open **Content hub**.  

    2. Ensure you are working in the **Personal Banking** workspace.
    3. Navigate the **Folders** tab and locate or create the folder where your campaign images should live.  

    4. Let’s also create a subfolder like _Family Savings Campaign_ to keep assets easy to find later.


[![Choose the correct workspace and create folder structure](docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/correct-workspace-and-folders.png)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/correct-workspace-and-folders.png)
Why does it matter? A logical [folder hierarchy](modules/work-with-assets/understand-working-with-assets) makes browsing and permissions simpler for everyone.
  1. **Start a bulk upload**
    1. Next to the **New content item** button, use the arrow to open dropdown menu and select **Upload files**. [![Upload button](docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/upload-button.png)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/upload-button.png)
    2. Select the files you want to upload from your source folder in the upload dialog.  

    3. Use **Open** to confirm selected files and begin the upload.
    4. Once the files are successfully uploaded, you can **Close** the upload dialog. [![Upload queue](docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/selected-files-during-upload.png)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/selected-files-during-upload.png)
    5. The _Assets_ are now in the _Draft (Initial)_ status, and you can check them and make further adjustments before you publish the assets.


During the upload, AIRA automatically tags and optimizes the images. You can then start adjusting them manually.
  1. **Check and adjust images**
    1. Open the image with the original filename _AdobeStock_445562436.jpeg_ and adjust: 
       * **Description** : _Image of a smiling woman with a credit card and laptop._
       * **Alt text** : _Smiling woman holding a credit card, looking into an open laptop computer._
       * Click the **Adjust image** icon to update the image variant. [![Adjust image](docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/adjust-image-variants.png)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/adjust-image-variants.png)
       * **Primary Image** changes to make: 
         * **Image format** : Change from _JPEG_ to _JPG_.
         * **Quality** : adjust the quality to _Medium 80%_
    2. **Save** the changes.
    3. Manually adjust the **focal point** of the _Primary image_. [![Manual focal point adjustment](docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/move-focal-point.gif)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/move-focal-point.gif)
    4. Check and adjust the crop in **Image variants** if needed. [![Adjust image variant crop](docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/adjust-image-variant-crop.jpg)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/adjust-image-variant-crop.jpg)
    5. **Save** your latest updates.


**Variant notes** :
Follow any team internal rules you might have on the image quality settings or where the focal point should typically go, such as “don’t lower the quality of the image below 50%” and “keep the focal point on people’s faces.”
  1. **Manually adjust predefined tags:**


  * Use the tag selector to add relevant tags from your project’s predefined list, such as _Young people_ and _Family setting_.
  * **Save** your changes to apply tags.  
[![AIRA-generated tags](docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/AIRA-generated-tags.png)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/AIRA-generated-tags.png)


Currently, you can only choose from predefined tags configured by your developer. You cannot create new tags in the _Content hub_ at the moment. However, it is still beneficial to follow a few best practices when it comes to tagging.
  * Prefer specific tags over vague labels like _misc_ or _general_.
  * Reuse existing tags rather than inventing near-duplicates (for example, choose _Buildings_ over adding a new tag _House_).  

  * Keep it focused: aim for 3 to 6 precise tags per asset to improve search accuracy.  

  * Follow team conventions for consistency.


  1. **Inspect another image to verify results**
    1. Open newly uploaded image.  

    2. Confirm it has the expected tags and a clear description.  

    3. Make minor edits if needed, then **Save**. [![Check images for last updates](docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/check-image-for-last-updates.png)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/check-image-for-last-updates.png)
  2. **Final tidy-up and quality check**
    1. Ensure all images reside in the **correct folder** with the proper naming and tags.  

    2. Use **Filters** in the folder, for example, filter by **Content type** (_Asset_), or by **Taxonomy** tags you just applied (to confirm your tagging works as expected).
    3. If an image does not fit this campaign, move it to a more suitable folder, or make any last adjustments now.  
[![Filter assets in folder for last checks](docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/filter-assets-in-folder.png)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/filter-assets-in-folder.png)
  3. **Publish your assets**
    1. Select all assets in the folder by checking off the **Content item name** checkbox, or one by one if you want to select only some.
    2. **Publish** all selected items in bulk. [![Publish selected assets](docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/publish-selected-assets.png)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/publish-selected-assets.png)
    3. If unsure about the result, verify that the status of the selected assets has changed from _Draft (Initial)_ to _Published_. [![Published assets status](docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/published-assets-status.png)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/published-assets-status.png)


Nice work! You’ve just uploaded and organized a larger set of images in one smooth process. By using bulk upload, AIRA-assisted tagging and adding alt description, and creating manually updated variants, you’ve built a tidy, reusable library that will save you and your team time later.
