[Smart folders](documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#smart-folders) let you create dynamic groups of assets in _Content hub_. Unlike regular folders, which hold specific items until you move them, smart folders automatically include items that match your defined filter. As assets change, for example, when AIRA applies taxonomy tags or [adds image description](documentation/business-users/aira#automatically-generate-image-description)or editors publish them, assets move in and out of the _smart folder_ automatically.
To quickly find content you are responsible for, you can create smart folders:
  * Assets tagged with _Campaign 2025_ to collect assets with relevant taxonomy [tag](guides/digital-marketing/work-with-taxonomies/taxonomies).
  * Images modified in the last 7 days.
  * Images in _Draft_ status waiting for review.


Unlike [folders](modules/work-with-assets/work-with-content-folders), a single asset can appear in multiple _smart folders_ , which makes them helpful in managing different workflows without duplicating content. Because smart folders update automatically, you don’t need to remember to move items in and out. They stay accurate as the underlying assets change.
## Deliver content dynamically with smart folders
For projects where developers have [enabled dynamic content delivery](guides/development/advanced-content/deliver-content-dynamically-with-smart-folders), _smart folders_ can also control which assets are displayed on your website channels. You can manage which assets appear live by [editing the filter conditions](documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders#edit-smart-folders) in _Content hub_ without needing code changes.
For example, your team could:
  * Update a campaign smart folder filter to include new images; the website will automatically display them.
  * Remove outdated assets from a smart folder, instantly updating what users see in the related channel.


This makes smart folders especially powerful for teams managing campaigns or time-sensitive updates, as the filtering logic stays centralized in _Content hub_.
