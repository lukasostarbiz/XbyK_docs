# Image AI features
Xperience [AIRA](/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/aira-configuration) provides additional features when it comes to images stored in the _Content hub_. It can automatically adjust images when you upload them by, for example, **automatically selecting the image focal point** and creating **different image variants for desktops and mobile devices**. This ensures your audience sees the best version of your image, no matter their device.
If you want more control over how the final image looks, you can **manually adjust the focal point** to crop the image appropriately before saving the new content item.

You can test this for yourself and instantly see how changing the focal point also **adjusts the cropped variants** of the image to be in line with the newly selected focal point.
