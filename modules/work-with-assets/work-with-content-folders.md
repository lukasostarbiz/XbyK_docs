# Work with content folder hierarchy
A good folder hierarchy helps editors find and reuse assets. It doesn’t change where assets are stored in _Content hub_ ; they always remain in the same flat workspace. _Content folders_ help you create a logical way for your team to navigate to them.
You can create as many folders and nest them as deeply as you need.
To create folders:
  1. Open _Content hub_ within the **workspace** where you want to organize assets.
  2. Create a **parent folder** for a major category of your assets.
  3. If needed, select this _parent folder_ and create **subfolders** for more specific groupings.
  4. Repeat this process until you have a clear and simple structure.


Let’s test it out in the Kbank demo site. Kbank runs personal and business banking websites. Editors need to manage product images for both sites, as well as campaign graphics. They want to create the following structure inside their _Kbank Global Media Assets_ workspace:
  * Top-level folders: 
    * Accounts
    * Cards
    * Insurance
    * Loans
  * Subfolders under **Cards** : 
    * Balance transfer
    * Rewards
    * Premier
  * Temporary subfolders for campaigns: 
    * Under **Balance transfer** , a _Fall 2025 campaign_ subfolder to store campaign-specific banners and promotional graphics.


This structure helps editors find the right asset quickly without scrolling through unrelated files. The **breadcrumb navigation** shows them exactly where they are in the folder tree. Campaign teams know where to upload temporary images and can easily clean up the campaign subfolders once the promotion ends.

Keep your folder structure simple. Two to three levels of folders will suffice for most projects that keep assets alongside other content within the _Content hub_. Editors find complex hierarchies harder to navigate and maintain.
## Move items into content folders
Once you have a folder structure, you can organize your assets into the right folders. Remember, moving items doesn’t mean creating copies of files; moving just assigns these content items to a folder so they are easier to find.
Let’s continue within the Kbank demo site.
  1. Ensure you are in the _Kbank Global Media Assets_ repository.
  2. Select the items you want to organize: _Balance transfer card_ and _Female with credit card_.
  3. Use the **Move** action above the content items and choose the **Cards** > **Balance transfer** subfolder in the folder tree.
  4. Use **Move** to confirm.


Select the _Balance transfer_ folder to confirm that your items appear correctly. Then, open the **All items view** to verify that the _Balance transfer card_ asset is still available in the workspace in _Content hub_ and its _Location_ has been updated.
