# Work with asset files in Content hub
Storing files in _Content hub_ means you can reuse them in different digital marketing activities across your marketing [channels](/guides/digital-marketing/work-with-channels/digital-marketing-channels). Assets in the _Content hub_ provide you with helpful features that make managing large projects a breeze.
You can preview all content items with images (in Kbank based on the _Asset_ content type) and switch between view modes to suit your current [workflow](/guides/digital-marketing/work-with-workflows/workflows).

If you need to add multiple files to the _Content hub_ at once, use the **Upload files** button.

You can also upload an image **directly from a widget** while editing a page.

When you upload an image (whether through the _Content hub_ or a widget), Xperience can automatically create [image variants](/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets#image-variants) for different devices and applies [taxonomy tags](/guides/digital-marketing/work-with-taxonomies/taxonomies#what-are-taxonomy-trees-tags-or-parent-child-relationships) to help categorize the images.
Automatic image tagging works only for mass image uploads. If you upload a single image into a content item, the auto-tagging process may not be triggered, so you’ll have to assign the tags manually.
For more details on tags and taxonomy, check out our material on [working with taxonomies](/guides/digital-marketing/work-with-taxonomies/work-with-taxonomies-in-kbank).
The automatic taxonomy tags are generated using [Azure AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services), which means results can vary. The same image may receive slightly different tags at different times, as the process is not standardized. You can, however, review and edit these tags as needed.

To ensure no unapproved data is published live, you can apply different [content management workflows](/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/workflows). You can also fully control who on your team uses the assets and how they use them through [workspaces](/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/workspaces).
You can also create asset variants for different languages to ensure that your visitors receive properly [localized content](/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages), and use [taxonomies](/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/taxonomies) to categorize your images accordingly.
Note that assets in _Content hub_ don’t support versioning. If you replace a file, only the latest version is available. To learn more, see the [Content versioning](/documentation/business-users/content-versioning#assets) page.
Xperience also provides an out-of-the-box method to **restrict access** to a file, meaning only logged-in visitors can view or access it.
