**Media libraries are a legacy feature** and have been officially sunset. Their related API members are marked as obsolete, and support will end on **July 24, 2026** , after which the feature and all associated APIs will be removed. If your project still uses media libraries, discuss [our migration guide](guides/architecture/media-libraries-migration-guidance) and the migration of media library files to [Content hub](documentation/business-users/content-hub) with your developers.
In previous versions of Kentico, media libraries stored file types such as images, videos, and audio files for use on websites. While they worked similarly to assets in the _Content hub_ , they offered fewer customization options, only had a predefined set of fields, and could not be secured (meaning that anyone with the direct file URL could access them).

For all of the above reasons, the clear way forward is to organize, optimize, and safeguard your assets in the _Content hub_.
