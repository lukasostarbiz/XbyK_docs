Images bring your content to life, but they don’t always fit neatly into every space across your website, emails, and other marketing channels. A photo that looks great in a wide hero banner might not work as well in a square thumbnail or a social media preview. Instead of uploading multiple versions of the same image yourself, **Xperience by Kentico** can generate **image variants** for you and even detect the best **focal point**.
Let’s explore how to make the most of these features in _Xperience_ so that your images are always sharp, relevant, and well-framed, no matter where they appear.
## What we’ll cover
  * What image variants and focal points are.  

  * How Xperience automatically optimizes and crops your images.  

  * How to adjust the focal point to direct attention to the important part of your image.  

  * When and how to use manual cropping for more control.  

  * How to share image variants outside of Xperience.


By the end, you’ll know how to prepare **professional and consistent images** , no matter where your audience sees them.
