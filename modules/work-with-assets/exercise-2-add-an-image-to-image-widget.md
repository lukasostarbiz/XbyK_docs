# Exercise 2 -- Add an image to the Premier credit card image widget
Now that you know the basics of working with assets in Xperience, let’s add an image to a page that only your editor team will be able to manage. Follow these steps to **add an image to the empty image widget** on the website channel’s **Premier credit card** page.
To follow along with the exercise, download a [sample image file](https://download.kentico.com/Training/exercise-sample-manage-files-man-holding-credit-card.png) we prepared for you.
  1. **Open the page for editing**
     * In the **Personal Banking** channel, navigate to the **Cards** section.
     * Open the _Premier credit card_ page and **Edit page**.
  2. **Select the empty Image widget**
     * The empty image widget needs setup.
     * Open the widget properties to insert the sample image you downloaded. [![Image widget properties](/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/empty-image-widget-properties.png)](/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/empty-image-widget-properties.png)
  3. **Create a new image**
     * In the image properties dialogue, choose _Content hub asset_.
     * To add a new picture, select **Create new** , and choose the following in the **Create new item** dialogue: 
       1. **Content item name** – Enter a clear, descriptive name, like _Premier credit card holder_.
       2. **Workspace** – Select the _Personal Banking_ workspace.
       3. **Location** – Leave the default _Uncategorized (no folder)_.
       4. **Content type** – Select _Asset_ and **Continue**.
       5. **Description** – Add a meaningful description to help your team understand where and how to use the picture. Like: _Image of a young man holding a credit card, to be used as a Premier credit card product image._
       6. **Alt text** – description of image content to enhance usability. In this case: _Smiling man holding a credit card._
       7. **File** – Upload the _exercise-sample-manage-files-man-holding-credit-card.png_ file.
       8. **Tags** – Select one or more tags that best describes what’s in the image, like _Young people_. Consistent tagging helps with search and asset reuse later.
     * **Save and Close** your newly created content item. This step will return you to the **Image properties** dialogue, where you can finish setting up your image widget.

  4. **Adjust widget display settings**


  * After inserting the image, you can adjust how it appears on the page before you save the image properties.
  * You can, for example, display the image as _Large_ to make it less limited in height.
The available options depend on your project’s configuration, so the options in your project may differ from our example.


  1. **Save your changes**


  * **Apply** the changes you just made, and **Save** the page to **Preview** your updates.
  * If you’re happy with the newly created image, return to the **Page Builder** view and **Publish** the new version of the _Premier credit card_ page.


The page should look something like the following image: [![Premier credit card page with new image](/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/premier-credit-card-with-new-product-image.png)](/docsassets/guides/manage-files-essentials/premier-credit-card-with-new-product-image.png)
### See where your image is used before making any changes
Before you edit or remove an image, take a moment to review the impact of your changes with the _Content Reuse Locator_. You’ll find [this tool](https://www.kentico.com/discover/blog/content-reuse-locator) in the **Used in** [tab](/documentation/business-users/website-content#used-in) of the asset details within Content hub. The _Used in_ tab shows every page or content item that references the image. You can confidently update or change the image while knowing how your changes affect other content.
