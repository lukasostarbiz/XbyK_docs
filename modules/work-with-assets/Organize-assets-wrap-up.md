By now, you’ve seen how Xperience helps you keep files organized and easy to reuse. You also practiced uploading and working with image assets directly from a widget. These skills make it easier to handle your daily tasks with less manual effort and much faster than before.
Use _Content hub_ to:
  * Store and reuse assets across different channels.  

  * Upload files directly in the _Content hub_ or from within an image widget.
  * Use multi-file upload to speed up and simplify your asset management.
  * Benefit from automatic image variants and taxonomy tags.  

  * Use AIRA to process and optimize images for better performance automatically.  

  * Add and configure images in widgets to control how they display on your site and on different devices.  

  * Improve working with assets when compared to _Media libraries_.
