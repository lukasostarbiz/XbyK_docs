Managing your project’s files doesn’t have to be a complicated chore. In **Xperience by Kentico** , you can keep all your important assets in one place, making it easier to find and update them. They can also be reused whenever you need. In Xperience, you can store various file types, including images, videos, PDFs, presentations, documents, and more. All assets are stored within the [Content hub](documentation/business-users/content-hub), your central repository for reusable marketing content.
The assets in the _Content hub_ are based on a custom [content type](guides/architecture/content-modeling/content-modeling-guide/what-is-a-content-type). Depending on your project [implementation](guides/architecture/content-modeling/content-modeling-guide/store-files#store-images-and-other-assets-in-the-content-hub), you’ll be working with _Images_ , _Media_ , or _Assets_. For example, in the Kbank demo site, you’ll work with the **Asset** content type.

Don’t have the demo Kbank website yet? You’ll need one to follow up on the exercises. If you don’t have your demo site set up, request the **Xperience by Kentico – Business Tutorial Kbank demo site** through a [form at Kentico website](https://www.kentico.com/services/training/training-website-requests).
We’ll show you the basics so you can easily store and manage your assets, and make your everyday marketing tasks a lot easier.
