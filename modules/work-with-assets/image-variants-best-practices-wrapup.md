You’ve seen that with image variants and focal points, you don’t need to manually create multiple versions of the same image. Instead, you can rely on Xperience’s intuitive automation to guide you to **better pictures with far less effort**. And if you still want some control over how your images look and display? Play with finding your own sweet spot between **leveraging AIRA’s automated image optimization capabilities and manually adjusting image variants** where necessary.
The result? You’ll work faster, but your visuals will always look great, no matter where they appear on your website or beyond.
