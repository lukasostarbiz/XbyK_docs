Module: Work with assets
21 of 21 Pages
# Continue learning about assets
Great work! You’ve mapped a clear path from scattered files to a structured, reusable asset library. You learned how **Content hub** differs from media libraries, how to keep navigation simple with content folders, and how workspaces protect brand assets while enabling collaboration. You also explored smart folders for dynamic filtering and delivery, plus image variants and focal points (with help from AIRA) to keep visuals crisp across devices.
Next steps: align on folder names and workspace boundaries with your team, add a few smart folders to support campaigns or reviews, and audit tags for clarity and reuse. With a light governance layer and these tools working together, your assets will stay organized, consistent, and ready for anything your marketing plan throws at them.
