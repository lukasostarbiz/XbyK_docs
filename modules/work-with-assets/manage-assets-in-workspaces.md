# Use workspaces to manage assets
[Media libraries](/documentation/business-users/media-libraries) kept all “files” separated from other content, which is not the case in _Content hub_.
Depending on how your editors feel about it, you might want to create a dedicated _workspace_ to store all files that different teams should access. You might also need to define what editors can or cannot do with the assets.
Imagine that [workspaces](/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/workspaces) in Xperience are containers for content in the _Content hub_. Content in the _Content hub_ always belongs to one specific workspace.
Your [administrator](/guides/digital-marketing/xperience-essentials/work-with-roles-essentials) assigns you access to the _workspaces_ and other system parts. No matter which application you work in, whether the _Content hub_ or a website channel, your _role_ defines which resources you can access.
This means:
  * Your role determines which _workspaces_ you can view and edit.
  * You stay within that _workspace_ when working in _Content hub_.
  * You can switch between _workspaces_ whenever you need.

Your browser does not support the video tag. 
Depending on your role’s permissions, you’ll be allowed different [operations](/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management) within the workspace:
  * **View** – Editors can use the assets in their work, but cannot change or delete them.
  * **Create** , **Update** – Editors can reuse and change (update) assets.
  * **Delete** – Editors can remove existing assets.


Your access to _website channels_ is also based on the _role_ (not workspace). This allows organizations to maintain _independent asset management_ and _channel editing permissions_ , so that teams get only the necessary access level.
From an organizational perspective, setting up a workspace to collect your company’s assets does more than group images in one place. It creates a shared space where:
  * Content is organized consistently across the system.
  * Permissions and access levels are applied reliably.
  * Editors and teams can collaborate without stepping on each other’s work.


Let’s take a look at an example. The Kbank demo site uses _three websites_ managed in Xperience, and a _number of other channels_ :
  * _Personal banking website_
  * _Business banking website_
  * _Mortgages website_
  * _Email Marketing_
  * _Headless app_


The Kbank teams organize their assets into these _workspaces_ :
  * **Brand Assets** workspace. This workspace contains official logos, icons, and approved images. Editors in all channels can reuse these, but only the design team can modify them.
  * **Kbank Global Media Assets** workspace. This workspace holds images that all teams share, such as generic promotional graphics. Editors from any channel can add and update these items.
  * **Channel-specific workspaces**. _Personal banking_ and _Business Banking_ website channels have their own workspace for content and assets used only on that website. _Access permissions_ , such as [page-level permissions](/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/page-permission-management), are limited so editors from one channel cannot accidentally change content in another website that they are not allowed to change.


This structure gives editors a consistent experience across Xperience applications while keeping each area organized and secure.

Plan your workspace structure early. If your teams or projects grow, you can add new workspaces or adjust permissions without disrupting the rest of the system.
