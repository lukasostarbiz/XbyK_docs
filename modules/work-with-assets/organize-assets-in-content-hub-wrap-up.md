# Organize assets in Content hub wrap up
We recommend using _Content hub_ to store and manage all reusable assets, from images, icons, and videos to documents and campaign graphics. If you are working in a larger team and need to limit which teams have access to which assets, organize your assets into _workspaces_. Group items into _content folders_ within the workspace. Improve flexibility by introducing _smart folders_ and creating dynamic asset collections that update automatically as items change.
A well-planned structure helps teams of any size work more efficiently, prevents duplication or accidental changes, and keeps assets consistent across websites, apps, and other channels. By combining clear workspace permissions, meaningful folder names, and smart folders for dynamic organization or delivery, your team can keep _Content hub_ tidy and ready to support your projects as they grow.
