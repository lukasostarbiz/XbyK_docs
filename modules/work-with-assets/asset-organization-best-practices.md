Organizing assets in _Content hub_ takes more than creating folders, especially in large projects. You need to create a well-structured system to help editors keep their projects maintainable. The following best practices will help you build and maintain a structure that works for everyone.
### Use workspaces to manage access and scope
Workspaces are where you define who can use and edit assets. Use them to protect brand-critical assets and allow teams to share standardized resources across teams or only among themselves using dedicated workspaces. For example, limit editing rights in a _Brand assets_ workspace to only the company’s graphic designers, but allow website editors to use those assets in their work.
### Use folders for organization, not permissions
Folders are only for grouping assets to make them easier to find. They don’t control access or editing rights.
### Use smart folders to filter relevant content
_Smart folders_ let you group assets based on _filters_ , such as _tags_ , _status_ , or _modification dates_. They update automatically as assets change, which is useful for tracking campaign materials, reviewing drafts, or managing recently uploaded files. Use them to create _views_ over content that you are responsible for.
### Publish catalogs or galleries dynamically
Developers can use the [dynamic content delivery](guides/development/advanced-content/deliver-content-dynamically-with-smart-folders) in _smart folders_ and feed _media catalogs_ or _galleries_ directly to your website channels. For example, you could maintain a _New products_ smart folder or a _Featured campaign_ folder, and the website or app will automatically display the right assets without manual updates.
### Keep folder names clear and meaningful
Choose simple, descriptive folder names so anyone can understand where to find an asset, for example, use _Credit cards_ instead of _CC2025_Materials_. Clear names save time and reduce mistakes.
### Avoid deep folder structures
Two or three levels of folders are enough for most projects. Complex hierarchies make navigation slower and harder to maintain, especially for new team members.
### Review and clean up folders regularly
Embrace temporary folders, such as those for campaigns. At the same time, to prevent clutter, put a process in place to regularly review and clean up folders that are no longer needed.
