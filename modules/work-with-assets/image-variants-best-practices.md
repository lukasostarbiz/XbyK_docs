Here are a few best practices to keep in mind when working with image variants and focal points:
  * Work with your administrators to ensure the right variant dimensions are in place before you begin your project.
  * If there are any team/company-wide requirements, stick to them.
  * Make use of AIRA’s automated focal point detection to keep the image cropping consistent and automated.  

  * Rely on manual cropping only when you need precise control.  

  * Always preview your image variants before publishing.  

  * If you need an image that cannot be in any way adjusted, cropped or focused, e.g., for legal or copyright reasons, store it as a [restricted image content type](guides/architecture/content-modeling/content-modeling-guide/store-files#restricted-image-content-type).
  * Share optimized images and variants via URL in just a few clicks.
