Module: Data protection configuration
6 of 6 Pages
# Where to go from here
You’ve completed the Data protection configuration module. Here is a recap of the key takeaways:
  * Xperience supports GDPR and similar privacy regulations.
  * Personal data fields are flagged to simplify management and compliance.
  * Built-in tools let you define, display, and track customer consents.
  * You can process data access and deletion requests manually or via the API.
  * Data can be anonymized or deleted based on your needs.
  * The system is flexible and can be extended to match your project requirements.


## What’s Next?
The data protection feature in Xperience needs to be prepared by the development team.
Now that you’re familiar with the data protection features, as a non-technical user, you can review your current privacy policies to help your team prepare for the implementation.
If your role is technical (technical team lead, developer, software architect, etc.) or you’re interested in technical details and mechanics of the Data protection implementation, visit [our documentation](/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection) to gain a deeper understanding of the feature. See our [technical guides](/guides/development/data-protection) for an example implementation.
