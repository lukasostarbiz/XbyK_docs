Xperience by Kentico’s _Continuous integration_ feature allows you to manage database objects through source control using the _[.NET Command Line Interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/)_. 
While the process is described in [the documentation](documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-integration), seeing a walkthrough is often helpful.
In this video, Sean Wright walks through the process of propagating data and schema changes from one developer instance of Xperience to another using continuous integration.
The following video shows Xperience by Kentico release v26. CI/CD has been updated to include new Xperience features. Find out more information in the product [Changelog](documentation/changelog). You can read about [different CI/CD development scenarios](https://community.kentico.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-ci-cd-developer-scenarios) on the [Community portal](https://community.kentico.com/).
