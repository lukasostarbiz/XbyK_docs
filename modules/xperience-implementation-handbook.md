Every successful digital project starts with a strong foundation. This module brings together the practical insights and proven best practices of Kentico solution architects to help you plan, build, and maintain your Xperience by Kentico project with confidence.
We’ve identified seven key phases that guide the typical project journey – from early planning through to post-launch maintenance. Whether you follow these steps sequentially or return to them iteratively, each phase includes the core concepts, decision points, and recommendations you’ll need to move forward effectively.
In this module, you’ll explore how to:
  * Gather project requirements to clarify business needs and technical goals from the start.
  * Evaluate Xperience’s capabilities and align platform features with your project objectives.
  * Plan your content model based on sound information architecture and editorial workflows.
  * Develop your project using environment setup and coding best practices tailored for Xperience.
  * Approach testing to ensure the security and functionality of large projects.
  * Deploy to a new environment with tools and processes that support smooth transitions.


Whether you’re starting a new build or refining an existing solution, this module is designed to help you avoid common pitfalls and make informed decisions every step of the way.
