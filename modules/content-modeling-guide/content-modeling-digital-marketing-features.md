# Digital marketing features and content modeling
## Plan your content model around business needs
A good content model that matches your business’s unique requirements and challenges is vital to a successful online presence. When deciding how to model content in Xperience, always respect the project’s business requirements and the preferences of website editors and marketers.
On this page, you can learn about general recommendations that you or your developers should consider when planning the content model for your project.
## Digital marketing features
Xperience comes with a set of digital marketing features. Marketers can use these features to attract new customers, promote content, or automate workflows to keep in touch with existing customers. Using digital marketing can directly impact your content model and how content editors work with the content.
Find out more about the digital marketing features in the [documentation](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing).
**Recommendations – Digital marketing**
  * If you want to leverage the built-in digital marketing features, **store your content in the Content hub** and **use Page Builder widgets and page templates to display it**.
  * We recommend using Page Builder on pages where your editors benefit from [content personalization](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/widget-personalization). Marketers can personalize their content based on contact groups across the website. 
    * Typical examples of content personalization include **frequently changed pages** , such as the website’s home page, campaign landing pages, or thank-you pages. Marketers create variants of content that is dynamically displayed to different visitors based on visitors’ previous interactions with the website and business.
    * Less common scenarios include personalization on **pages that display aggregated content**. For example, an _Articles_ listing page can contain an editable area with a _Featured articles_ widget. Editors can personalize the widget and offer different featured articles to visitors based on their assigned contact groups or based on the phase of the visitors’ contact journey.
    * Developers need to **prepare custom Page Builder widgets** that allow editors to personalize content based on contact groups.
  * Use custom content assets type and **store your images, PDFs, videos, and other similar media in the Content hub**. If you need to upload large amounts of data in bulk, use [mass asset upload](/documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets#mass-asset-upload).
  * For collecting data from users, we recommend using **built-in[forms](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms)**. Ensure that your editors have rich options for customization of their forms via custom [Form Builder components](/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder). Include requirements for custom form components, their styling properties, or custom form section properties in your project requirements. Once developers prepare your project, editors can adjust their forms’ layout to match the rest of the pages.
  * We recommend using the [Data protection](/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection) and [cookies](/documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/cookies) functionality to ensure your website complies with relevant legislation.
