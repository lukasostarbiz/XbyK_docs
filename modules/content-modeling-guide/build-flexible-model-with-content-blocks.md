A **content block** is a piece of content that is not a full page but still carries semantic or functional meaning within your digital content. _Content blocks_ are typically reusable across multiple pages or app screens; they can repeatedly appear in emails or can be shared externally through a headless API. Storing this content in a structured format in _Content hub_ helps your content stay consistent and accurate and reduces unnecessary duplication if editors need to share this data across channels.
_Content blocks_ :
  * Have semantic meaning (they represent a specific type of information, like an FAQ section or a call to action).
  * Can be composed of multiple other structured content items (e.g., an FAQ block contains individual FAQ items).
  * Are usually reused across your website or other channels (like email or apps).
  * Live in the _Content hub_ (in dedicated folders), in a structured format to support reuse, filtering, and consistent presentation.
  * Allow editors to insert dynamic, reusable content without duplicating work.


You can see some examples of _content blocks_ that we’ve seen in Kentico projects.
  * Collection of **FAQs** for **product** or **support** pages.
  * **Hero banners** with global **links** and **promotional messages**.
  * **Accordion sections** for structured expandable content on landing pages.
  * **Speaker** or **author** **profiles** (when you don’t need to build full author pages).
  * **Office addresses** with **office hours** for multiple location listings.
  * **Testimonial sliders** used across product and marketing pages.
  * **Feature highlights** that display key benefits in a reusable component.
  * **Call-to-action sections** encouraging sign-ups, demos, or contact requests.
  * **Event highlights** showcasing upcoming events on various landing pages.
  * **Teaser** or **Featured content** cards for articles, products, or services that help editors overwrite the default content in product or service content items.
  * **Image galleries** reused across different campaign pages.
  * **Pricing lists** displayed consistently on product or service pages.
  * **Contact information** blocks that maintain consistent formatting across regions.
