Module: Content modeling guide
28 of 28 Pages
# Keep learning about content modeling
Even though content models show similarities across different organizations, every model is unique. Projects where editors and other website stakeholders collaborate on defining are more successful in results and user satisfaction.
## Wrapping up
The key points for building content models in Xperience by Kentico are:
  * Favor structured content and use widgets for styling rather than storing the content in website pages.
  * Depending on the skillset of the editor team, consider breaking up complex content types into several smaller types to improve content reusability and overall content composing experience.
  * Regularly validate your model with stakeholders, both internal and external.
  * Website developers should use the created content model and create content on the website themselves.
  * Feel free to experiment or deviate from the recommendations above to satisfy the project requirements.
