[Xperience Portal](documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal) provides simple access to all your Xperience SaaS projects, making it easy to view their status, monitor their performance, and handle everyday management tasks. This guide will help you navigate the necessary steps to access your Xperience Portal project for the first time and enable your team to work on it. By following these instructions, you’ll ensure a smooth onboarding process.
## Sign in to Xperience Portal
After your project is created, you’ll get an invitation email from Xperience Portal (_noreply@xperience-portal.com_). Xperience Portal sends this invitation to the contact specified in your purchase order.
To access your [Xperience Portal](documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal) project:
  1. Click the link in the email invitation. When you click the link, Xperience Portal will be opened in a new browser window.  
[![Invitation to Xperience Portal](docsassets/guides/get-started-with-saas/cloud-invitation.png)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/get-started-with-saas/cloud-invitation.png)
     * **Note** : For security reasons, the link in the email invitation expires after 10 days. If the link expires before you sign in to your Xperience Portal project, [contact our support team](https://www.kentico.com/services/support) to request a new invitation.
  2. Create your password. You’ll use your email and this password to access all the projects you’ve been invited to in Xperience portal. There’s no need to manage separate credentials, this new account gives you access to every project you were invited to.
  3. Set up the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in Xperience Portal:  
[![Multi-Factor Authentication](docsassets/guides/get-started-with-saas/cloud-mfa.png)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/guides/get-started-with-saas/cloud-mfa.png)
    1. Scan the QR code with your preferred authenticator application.
    2. Enter the [one-time code](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-factors#one-time-passwords) generated by your authenticator.
  4. After you enter the one-time code, you’ll see a [recovery code](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factor-authentication-factors#recovery-codes). Copy this code and save it in a safe place. You can use it to regain access to the Xperience Portal if you ever lose the device you use for two-factor authentication.


You now have access to Xperience Portal. The next step is to [invite](modules/get-started-with-saas/get-started-with-saas#invite-your-technical-team) the members of your technical team into the project.
## Users in Xperience Portal
Xperience Portal uses a role-based system. This means each team member gets access based on their role. It helps make sure everyone has the right permissions to do their work.
There are 3 distinct roles in Xperience Portal:
  * **Developer** – This role has the most limited access. _Developers_ can work in non-production environments, such as QA or UAT, and create their own [personal access tokens](documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal#personal-access-tokens) (PATs) to connect tools or services.
  * **DevOps Engineer** – In addition to everything a _Developer_ can do, _DevOps Engineers_ can also deploy changes to the live (production) environment. They can manage settings in the _Channels and Domains_ application and adjust the _Update schedule_ in the _System_ application.
  * **Tenant Administrator** – This role has full access. _Tenant Administrators_ can do everything _Developers_ and _DevOps Engineers_ can do. They can also manage [user access](documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal#users) in the _Users_ application and revoke personal access tokens (PATs) created by others.


For a full list of role privileges see [Reference - Xperience Portal user roles](documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal/reference-xperience-portal-user-roles).
## Invite your technical team
To invite a team member to your project:
  1. Open the **Users** application.
  2. Select **Invite user**.
  3. Enter the email address of the user you want to invite.
  4. Assign an [Xperience Portal role](documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal/reference-xperience-portal-user-roles) to the user and select **Invite**.
  5. Refer the invited user to [Access Xperience Portal for the first time](documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal#XperiencePortal-AccessPortal).


You have successfully invited a user to your project. To see all available options for managing users in Xperience Portal, check out [Users](documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal#users).
## Set up notifications
Stay informed about important updates in your Xperience Portal projects.
[Xperience Portal](documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal) automatically sends notifications to all users. You can choose which types of updates you want to receive, for example, deployments, errors, or environment changes, and in which environments (such as QA or PROD).
This helps you stay focused and only get alerts that are relevant to your work or responsibilities.
To customize your notifications:
  1. Open the **Notifications** application from the profile dropdown.
  2. Select which notifications to receive and in what environment. We recommend the [DDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) attack and _Failed deployment_ notifications. You can leave the others to your technical team.
