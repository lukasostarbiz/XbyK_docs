Module: Additional customizations
1 of 6 Pages
# Introduction to additional customizations
This module aggregates extra customization topics that are not part of longer series.
Learn about the tools available for integrating Xperience with third-party systems and customize the **Contact** class with additional fields, fine-tuning Xperience for more tailored use cases.
### Prerequisites
Some of the guides in this module are hands-on, and require the following:
  * Familiarity with [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/), [Dependency injection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection), and the [MVC pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview).
  * A running instance of Xperience by Kentico, preferably [29.6.1](/documentation/changelog) or higher. 
Some features covered in the Training guides may not work in older versions. 


**Code samples**
You can find a project with completed, working versions of code samples from this module and others in the [finished branch](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-training-guides/tree/finished) of the _Training guides_ repository.
The [main branch](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-training-guides) of the repository provides a starting point to code along with the guides.
The code samples in this guide are for [.NET 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8/overview) only.
They come from a project that uses [implicit using directives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/project-sdk/overview#implicit-using-directives). You may need to add additional `using` directives to your code if your project does not use this feature.
