# Introduction to securing pages
Sometimes, not all content should be visible to everyone. Whether you’re protecting internal information or offering content only to registered users, Xperience by Kentico lets you control who can access each page on your site.
In this section, you’ll learn how to:
  * Set up access restrictions for individual pages using the Security tab.
  * Require visitors to sign in before they can view certain content.
  * Apply security settings to subpages when needed.
  * Recognize secured pages by the lock icon in the content tree.


By the end, you’ll know how to restrict access to content on your site — so only the right people see the right pages.
