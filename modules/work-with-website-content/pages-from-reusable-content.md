10 of 20 Pages
# Construct pages from reusable content
Not all content starts from scratch — and it shouldn’t have to. In Xperience by Kentico, you can build website pages using reusable content items like articles or products that you plan to reuse across different marketing channels. This helps you keep information consistent across your site and makes updates easier down the line.
In this section, you’ll learn how to:
  * Use existing content items to create pages for your website.
  * Display structured content — such as articles or products — in a way that fits your site design.
  * Connect reusable content to widgets and templates that make it easy to manage and update.


By the end of this section, you’ll be able to turn your reusable content into live pages without duplicating work — keeping your site clean, flexible, and easy to update.
