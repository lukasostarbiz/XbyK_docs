Your content is only useful if people can find it — and page URLs play a big part in that. In Xperience by Kentico, you have full control over how URLs are created, updated, and redirected, so your pages stay accessible, user-friendly, and SEO-friendly, even when changes happen.
In this section, you’ll learn how to:
  * Edit and customize the URLs of your pages to make them clearer, more readable, and easier to find.
  * Handle changes to URLs safely by setting up redirects and managing older links to avoid broken pages.
  * Prevent issues like URL conflicts and keep your site’s structure clean by using tools like Former URLs and canonical links.


By the end of this section, you’ll be ready to manage your URLs with confidence — keeping your site organized, your visitors happy, and your SEO in good shape.
