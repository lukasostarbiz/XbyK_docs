**Page Builder** is a user-friendly UI feature that allows users to build pages using configurable widgets prepared by developers. Page Builder lets you easily display various types of content using widgets directly from within the Xperience administration.

**Page Builder** is available in website channel applications in the page menu of pages that have the [Page Builder enabled](documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder).
**Prerequisite**
A developer needs to set up the [Page Builder feature](documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder) and [prepare pages with editable areas](documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/create-pages-with-editable-areas), before you can create and manage content using this approach.
## Page Builder workflow
When working with Page Builder, you’ll often use the following workflow:
  1. Open a website channel application.
  2. In the content tree, select the page that you want to edit.
  3. Select **Page Builder** in the page menu on the right side of the interface.

  4. Make sure the page is in the _Draft_ status or another [custom workflow step](documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/workflows). 
     * If a page is already _Published_ select **Edit page**. This transitions the page to the _Draft_ step and enables editing and re-publishing.

     * When a page is _Unpublished_ , you first need to select **Create new version**. This transitions the page to the _Draft_ step and enables editing and publishing.
  5. [Adjust sections](modules/work-with-website-content/working-with-sections) to achieve your desired visual layout of the page.
  6. [Add widgets](modules/work-with-website-content/working-with-widgets) to the page to define the content.
