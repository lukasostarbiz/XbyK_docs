# Prevent URL collisions
A site cannot have two pages with identical URLs. Depending on the situation, the system handles collisions in two ways:
  1. By appending the page’s GUID at the end of the URL slug of the page. For example: _https://example.com/Articles/Tea-Blends-**ae64db90387143b1a4562e06b67d1970**_. This occurs when: 
     * You move a page and the destination already contains a page with a matching URL slug.

  2. By preventing the URL from changing and displaying an error message. This occurs when: 
     * You attempt to change the URL slug or a vanity URL of a page and the resulting URL matches one already in the system.
