# Discover how URLs work in Xperience
Xperience allows you to modify URLs of web pages on the **URLs** tab when editing a page in a website channel application. The system can also track changes of URLs and store old URLs for redirection purposes. These [former URLs](/modules/work-with-website-content/former-urls) can be managed in the **URLs** application.
The following types of URLs are available for pages:
  * [System URL](/modules/work-with-website-content/edit-page-urls) – Default URL [generated from the page’s position in the content tree](/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/routing/content-tree-based-routing) using the page’s URL slug and URL slugs of the page’s ancestors. The ‘slug’ is the part that comes at the very end of a URL, and refers to a specific page or post. For example, for the URL _example.com/Articles/News/Tea-Blends/_ , the URL slug is _’Tea-Blends_ ’. For more information about how page URLs are generated, see [Page URL generation](/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/routing/content-tree-based-routing#page-url-generation).
  * [Vanity URL](/modules/work-with-website-content/edit-page-urls) – Alternative URL that can be configured and customized by marketers. One page can have multiple vanity URLs. All configured vanity URLs across all pages are displayed in the **URLs** application. Vanity URLs can serve multiple purposes: 
    * Marketing and branding – You can create URLs that promote branding of your products and include recognizable words to improve your marketing reach.
    * Sharing – You can create a URL that is short and can be copied and shared easily, for example, on social media.
    * SEO – You can improve the SEO of the page by including SEO keywords in the URL of the page.
  * [Canonical URL](/modules/work-with-website-content/edit-page-urls) – Preferred URL of a page, i.e., the URL that is displayed to the user in the browser URL bar and is intended to be indexed by search engines. All URLs representing a page redirect to the canonical URL of the page via a “301 Moved Permanently” redirect. By default, the system URL is the canonical URL for each page. You can decide to [set a vanity URL as the canonical URL](/modules/work-with-website-content/edit-page-urls) of a page.


You can also create a temporary [shareable preview URL](/documentation/business-users/website-content#shareable-preview-urls) and send it to reviewers who can’t access the administration. This URL is not intended for regular live site visitors.
