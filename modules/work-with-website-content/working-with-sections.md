On a page where Page Builder is set up, you can do the following actions with sections. You can watch a video or read about the actions below.
UI elements that allow you to modify sections are gray:
  * **Add sections** – Click a gray  _plus_ button located on the left side of an editable area to insert a new section. The list of available sections depends on the implementation of your website.
  * **Move sections** – Hover over a section and drag it by the drag handle.
  * **Change section type** – You can change the type of a section to adjust the arrangement of a page. To do so, hover over the section you want to modify, click the section type button, and select the section type you want to use.
  * **Configure sections** (only displayed for configurable sections) – Click the configure button, edit the section properties in the configuration dialog, and click  _Apply_. Check with your site’s administrators or developers for more information about the section types on your website and their properties.
  * **Copy sections** – Select a section you want to copy and click the copy button in the upper right corner of the section to copy a section with all widgets in the section. 
    * You can paste the copied sections onto any page that uses the Page Builder using the _Add section_ button.
    * A section can only be pasted into an editable area if all widgets in the copied section and the section itself are allowed in the area.
    * The copy feature allows you to store up to 10 sections for 12 hours.
  * **Delete sections** – Hover over the section you want to remove and click the delete button in the upper right corner of the section.
