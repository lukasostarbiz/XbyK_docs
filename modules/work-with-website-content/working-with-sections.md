# Use sections to lay out the page
On a page where Page Builder is set up, you can do the following actions with sections. You can watch a video or read about the actions below.
UI elements that allow you to modify sections are gray:
  * **Add sections** – Click a gray  _plus_ button located on the left side of an editable area to insert a new section. The list of available sections depends on the implementation of your website.
  * **Move sections** – Hover over a section and drag it by the drag handle.
  * **Change section type** – You can change the type of a section to adjust the arrangement of a page. To do so, hover over the section you want to modify, click the section type button, and select the section type you want to use.
  * **Configure sections** (only displayed for configurable sections) – Click the configure button, edit the section properties in the configuration dialog, and click  _Apply_. Check with your site’s administrators or developers for more information about the section types on your website and their properties.
  * **Copy sections** – Select a section you want to copy and click the copy button in the upper right corner of the section to copy a section with all widgets in the section. 
    * You can paste the copied sections onto any page that uses the Page Builder using the _Add section_ button.
    * A section can only be pasted into an editable area if all widgets in the copied section and the section itself are allowed in the area.
    * The copy feature allows you to store up to 10 sections for 12 hours.
  * **Delete sections** – Hover over the section you want to remove and click the delete button in the upper right corner of the section.

Each section defines one or more zones, where you can add widgets.
After making any changes on the page, do not forget to click the **Save** button. Changes made to the sections can be previewed in the **Preview** mode.
