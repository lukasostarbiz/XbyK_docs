Re-platforming an existing solution can feel like a major undertaking – especially when your current project is well-established and complex. This module is here to help you understand the process and give you a clear path forward for upgrading from Kentico Xperience 13 to Xperience by Kentico.
Each section walks you through a specific phase of the upgrade journey, highlighting what to expect, how to prepare, and how to reduce complexity along the way.
In this module, you’ll learn how to:
  * Understand the upgrade process by exploring what’s involved and how to approach it from a high-level perspective.
  * Plan your feature migration strategy by assessing which parts of your current solution require more effort and how to break down the work.
  * Prepare your environment and migrate data using the **Kentico Migration Tool** , with guidance on setup and common migration tasks.
  * Adjust your codebase and adopt new platform features by refactoring existing functionality and taking advantage of improvements in Xperience by Kentico.


Whether you’re just beginning to plan or already preparing your environments, this module will help you navigate the upgrade process with greater clarity and confidence.
