The demo environment is not connected to an email server, so you won’t be able to send emails to real inboxes.
**Email statistics**
Xperience shows you essential information about your email performance. Open your email in the **Marketing Emails** channel application and switch to the **Statistics** tab. You can view the statistics of a tracked email once you’ve sent some emails. But for the time being, there won’t be any.
