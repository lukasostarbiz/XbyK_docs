Module: Work with emails

# Two main types of emails
_Regular_ emails provide additional options that allow you to send the email to contacts in a selected recipient list.
For detailed information about this scenario, see [Send regular emails to subscribers](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers).
### Send form autoresponder emails
After you create one or more _Form autoresponder_ emails, you can assign them to the autoresponder of a form:
  1. Open the **Forms** application in Xperience.
  2. Select the form in the list.
  3. Select **Autoresponder** in the options panel on the right.
  4. Pick an autoresponder email from the list.
  5. Select **Save**.


Whenever a user submits the form on your website, the system automatically sends them an email with the specified content and properties.
#### Set up automation processes
If you wish to set up a more advanced email scenario when a form is submitted, you can create an [automation process](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/automation) in the **Automation** tab. This allows you to send a series of multiple emails, add waiting intervals, or send different emails based on conditions.
**Send email** steps in automation processes support the following email purposes:
  * **Form autoresponder** – for scenarios where the process is triggered by an [email subscription form](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/emails/send-regular-emails-to-subscribers). Use the _Form autoresponder_ email to send the double opt-in link used to confirm the subscription. Typically, this is the first email sent by the automation process.
  * **Automation** – for all other emails sent as part of the automation process.


Once completed and enabled, the automation process is then triggered for any user who submits the form.
