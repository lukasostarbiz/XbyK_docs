Start with setting up a newsletter recipient list and set up a subscription and unsubscription email.
Contacts who decide to subscribe are stored in **recipient lists**. You want to create the correct recipient list for your email and inform your colleagues about its purpose.
  1. Open the **Recipient lists** application.
  2. Select **New recipient list**.
  3. Fill in the properties: 
    1. **Recipient list name** : _Mortgages form applicants_.
    2. **Description** : _Prospective Mortgages clients who submitted the Mortgages form_.
  4. In **Approval settings** , **Select existing page**. In the page tree, go to _Special pages_ , and select _Thank you (general)_ from the available pages.
  5. Do the same in **Unsubscribe settings** , but select _Newsletter unsubscription confirmation_ this time.
  6. **Save** your changes.


To complete the subscription process, you will link the recipient list to the form on the _Mortgages_ page. Once a visitor fills in the form, Xperience adds them to the recipient list.
