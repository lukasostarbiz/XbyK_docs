# Keep learning about upgrading to Xperience by Kentico
You’ve reached the end of the module on upgrading to Xperience by Kentico. Re-platforming a solution is no small task, but with the right guidance and tools, it becomes far more manageable – and even an opportunity to modernize your architecture and improve your long-term maintainability.
Let’s wrap it up:
  * You now have a high-level understanding of the upgrade process from Kentico Xperience 13 to Xperience by Kentico.
  * You can assess project complexity by identifying which features need adaptation or re-implementation.
  * You’re equipped to prepare your environment and transfer data using a structured, step-by-step approach.
  * You understand how to update your codebase to match the new platform architecture and benefit from modern features and best practices.


## Explore the Migration tool
To support your upgrade, we recommend exploring the [Kentico Migration Tool](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-kentico-migration-tool), which is a part of the official [Xperience by Kentico Migration Toolkit](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-migration-toolkit).
This tool helps you transfer content and other data from Kentico Xperience 11, 12, or 13 to Xperience by Kentico and supports incremental migration across multiple runs. You can use built-in and custom data transformations to fit your project’s needs.
Refer to our [Migration Tool](https://github.com/Kentico/xperience-by-kentico-kentico-migration-tool/blob/master/docs/Usage-Guide.md) documentation for step-by-step guidance and practical examples.
