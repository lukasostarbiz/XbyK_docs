# Introduction to modeling website presentation layer
A consistent and adaptable presentation layer is key to building scalable, maintainable websites. In this module, you’ll learn how to design and model the structural components that make up your site’s visual layout – from shared elements to reusable layout patterns – with a focus on long-term flexibility and alignment with your content architecture.
You’ll explore how to:
  * Define and organize presentation elements that support a unified visual design.
  * Create flexible layout structures that balance editor usability with design control.
  * Build modular, reusable components that integrate cleanly with your content model.


If you want to build a presentation layer that’s easy to maintain, supports reusability, and helps editors work more efficiently, this module is a great place to start. You’ll learn how to structure your website in a way that benefits both developers and content teams – now and as your site grows.
