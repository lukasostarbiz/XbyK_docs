# Introduction to website content
If you’re just getting started with managing content in Xperience by Kentico, you’re in the right place. Whether you’re adding a new page, updating text, or making sure content is only visible to the right people, this module will guide you through the essentials — step by step.
In this module, you’ll learn how to: 
  * Create website content using ready-made items like articles or products, so you don’t have to start from scratch each time.
  * Edit and manage page URLs to keep them clear, consistent, and easy for visitors (and search engines) to understand.
  * Control access to your pages, making sure only the right audience can view specific content when needed.
  * Use simple tools that help you keep your website tidy, up to date, and working as expected.


No technical skills are required — just a willingness to explore and try things out. By the end of this module, you’ll be ready to confidently manage your website content and keep everything running smoothly.
