1 of 8 Pages
# Overview
This is a how-to series that walks you through the deployment of an Xperience by Kentico solution from a **technical perspective**. Using a hands-on step-by-step approach, it demonstrates the key points about the Kentico SaaS deployment process using the Dancing Goat sample site. If you follow along, at the end, you will have an instance of Xperience by Kentico (XbyK) Dancing Goat deployed to your Xperience Portal.
## This series is for you if you…
  * Are an admin, developer, technical team leader, software architect, or other technical role.
  * Prefer learning by doing.
  * Work with a team that is considering using the Xperience Portal to deploy and maintain your XbyK solution.
  * Want hands-on experience with how the basic deployment process looks like.
  * Would like to go through a guided Xperience Portal deployment before deploying your own solution.


Before diving in, you need to have access to an Xperience Portal tenant: either your purchased instance or a Kentico-approved trial. If you are interested in a trial for evaluation purposes, [contact our sales team](https://www.kentico.com/how-to-buy/contact-sales).
