Keeping images, videos, and documents tidy shouldn’t slow you down. This module shows how to use media files in **Content hub’s** flat, reusable model, and how working from Content hub improves consistency of assets across all channels, and speeds up your content delivery.
You’ll learn how folders act as filters (not storage), how workspaces set access and scope, and how smart folders surface what’s relevant automatically. We’ll also touch on AIRA-assisted tagging and image optimization so your assets stay on brand across channels.
By the end, you’ll know how to plan a simple folder structure, separate shared vs. channel-specific assets with workspaces, build dynamic collections with smart folders, and make images look great everywhere using variants and focal points. You’ll practice with hands-on steps in the Kbank demo so you can apply the same patterns to your own project right away.
Let’s get started!
