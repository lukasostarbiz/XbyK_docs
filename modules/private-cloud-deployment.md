While [Xperience SaaS](guides/configuration/saas/get-started-with-saas) provides a hosting experience that is strongly integrated with Xperience by Kentico, some organizations may have policies or requirements that lead them to manage their own hosting in a private cloud environment.
This module includes guides and reference materials that will help you with the deployment and hosting of your Xperience by Kentico project on private infrastructure.
