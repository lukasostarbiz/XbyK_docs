Module: Xperience implementation handbook
9 of 9 Pages
# Continue learning about Xperience
We hope this handbook has given you a solid foundation and highlighted some of the key considerations to keep in mind as you move through each phase of your Xperience by Kentico project. Whether you’re starting a new implementation or refining an existing solution, thoughtful planning and best practices are essential to long-term success.
Throughout this module, you’ve learned how to:
  * Gather project requirements that reflect your team’s needs and business goals.
  * Evaluate Xperience’s capabilities and match them to your technical and strategic objectives.
  * Design a content model that supports scalable structure and editor workflows.
  * Set up development environments and apply best practices for coding and configuration.
  * Plan and execute testing to ensure quality and stability before go-live.
  * Deploy your project using tools and approaches suited to your environment and infrastructure.
  * Maintain and monitor your solution after launch to keep it secure, reliable, and ready to evolve.


These phases provide a roadmap for building with Xperience by Kentico – whether you’re moving through them step by step, or revisiting them in an iterative process.
## Keep security a priority
Security should be a continuous focus throughout your project lifecycle. To help you maintain security best practices from design through deployment, our security experts created comprehensive [Security checklists](/guides/architecture/xperience-implementation-handbook/security-checklists) that cover each phase of development. These checklists can help you identify potential risks early on, maintain compliance, and avoid costly security issues down the line.
## Continue learning
As your project progresses, we encourage you to keep learning. The [Xperience Community](https://community.kentico.com/) blog shares real-world examples, ideas, and best practices from our community. You can also dive deeper with our [Training guides](/guides/) and [official documentation](/documentation/) to explore topics in more detail.
## Share your thoughts
We’re always looking to improve our materials. If anything in this module was unclear or you think a topic needs further explanation, please let us know. Your feedback helps us make these resources more useful for you and others.
Thanks for learning with us – and best of luck with your next Xperience by Kentico project!
