## Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) in Form Builder
**CVSS** : 5.3  
**Affected versions** : 22.0.0 - 29.7.0  
**Category** : IDOR
### Summary
A vulnerability in the Form Builder’s authorization layer permitted the use of direct URLs created for another administration user’s [Form Builder](documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/create-and-edit-forms) context, which could potentially enable unauthorized modification of forms. However, this misuse would require the attacker to obtain the URL from an authorized user by some means, as the URL is generated by the server.
### How to fix
Update to the latest version. See [Update Xperience by Kentico projects](documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/update-xperience-by-kentico-projects) for detailed instructions.
