**[Deploy to the SaaS environment](documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment)**
Xperience by Kentico offers a [Software as a Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) (SaaS) environment that allows you to deploy, host, and maintain Xperience websites. You can install projects based on templates – a starting point for evaluating and developing Xperience websites, along with supporting tools and configuration for deploying the site to the SaaS environment.
**[Deploy to private cloud](documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-private-cloud)**
Xperience by Kentico supports traditional hosting options. You can run Xperience on dedicated or virtual servers, or manage your hosting on the [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) platform.
**[Continuous Deployment](documentation/developers-and-admins/ci-cd/continuous-deployment)**
The Continuous Deployment feature enables you to use Xperience projects in automated development and deployment flows. Convert website content and other objects from the database into XML files in a repository on the file system, and then restore the repository to the database in a target deployment environment (staging, UAT, production, etc.).
**[Deploy projects without the administration and related dependencies](documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-private-cloud/deploy-without-the-administration)**
Xperience projects can be deployed to production without dependencies on functionality only required by the Xperience administration. Learn how to configure your application to separate all unnecessary project dependencies during the publishing process automatically. 
**[Deploy projects in read-only mode](documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/read-only-deployments)**
Xperience projects can be deployed in read-only mode, which enables zero-downtime updates to your production database and file system. Switching traffic to a read-only deployment allows you to perform Xperience updates on your production application while continuing to serve content from a frozen snapshot of the data.
