# Enable content tree-based routing
Before you can start using [content tree-based routing](/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/routing/content-tree-based-routing), the related feature needs to be enabled in the Xperience .NET application.
  1. Open your project in Visual Studio and edit the **Program.cs** file.
  2. [Enable](/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/website-development-basics/configure-new-projects/enable-application-features) the content tree-based routing feature by calling `UseWebPageRouting` within `AddKentico`.
C#
**Program.cs**
Copy
```
using Kentico.Content.Web.Mvc.Routing;
using Kentico.Web.Mvc;

...

WebApplicationBuilder builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

...

builder.Services.AddKentico(features =>
{
    // Enables content tree-based routing
    features.UseWebPageRouting();
});
```



Content tree-based routing is now enabled for the application. The `Kentico().MapRoutes()` method called in your application’s startup pipeline registers a general route that matches URLs generated by the system for [content types](/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/content-types) with the _Include in routing_ option set.
## Optional routing configuration
  1. Edit your website channel in the **Channel management** application and switch to **Channel settings**.
  2. Under the **Content tree-based routing** section: 
     * Enter the tree path of your desired home page into the **Home page** field.
       * To find the **Tree path** of a page, open the website channel’s application, select the page, and go to **Properties → Information**.
       * The system displays the specified page when the root URL is accessed.
       * Using a unified home page URL is highly recommended because it prevents the duplicate content problem on your website’s most important URL.
     * Enable the **Store edited URLs as former URLs** setting if you want the system to keep track of [changes made to page URLs](/documentation/business-users/website-content/manage-page-urls) and perform redirects from former to current URLs.
       * To prevent the accumulation of various temporary URLs as former URLs, we recommend enabling this setting only on live websites (i.e. production environments).
  3. **Save** the changes.
