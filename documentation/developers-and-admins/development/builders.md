This section of the documentation discusses available builder functionality and the types of extensions developers can introduce.
**Page Builder**
[Page Builder](/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder) provides a user-friendly interface where users can manage page content using configurable widgets prepared by the developers.

You can find it on the **Form builder** tab of the **Forms** application when editing a form.
