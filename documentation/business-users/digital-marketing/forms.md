The **Forms** application enables content editors to create and edit forms. Forms allow you to gather structured data from website visitors. A typical example can be a “Contact Us” form or a form in which visitors provide some data required to attain a specific goal.
The system uses information provided via forms to update the [contacts](documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management) representing your website’s visitors (provided they give the necessary [consent](documentation/developers-and-admins/data-protection/consent-management)). For example, forms can be a way for visitors to provide their location or other information that your site’s developers can use to [personalize displayed content](documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/widget-personalization).
