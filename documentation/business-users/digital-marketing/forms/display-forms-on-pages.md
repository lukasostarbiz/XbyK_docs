# Display forms on pages
**Prerequisite**
A developer needs to [set up](/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder) Page Builder and prepare pages with editable areas before you can display forms on pages.
On pages where Page Builder is enabled, you can insert [forms](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/create-and-edit-forms) via the **Form** widget:
  1. Open a website channel application.
  2. Navigate to a page using the content tree.
  3. [Add](/documentation/business-users/website-content/widgets-and-page-builder) a **Form** widget to the desired editable area.

     * Choose an **After form submission** action, which occurs after a user submits the form: 
       * **Display text** – the text message specified here is displayed.
       * **Redirect to page** – another page on the website opens.
       * **Redirect to URL** – the user is redirected to the specified URL.
  6. Select **Apply**.
  7. **Save** the page.


You’ve now added the selected form to the page. [Submissions](/documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms/manage-form-submissions) collected by the form from visitors are available on the **Submissions** tab in the **Forms** application.
