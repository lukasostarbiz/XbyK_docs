Activities represent actions that your [contacts](documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management) perform. For example, the system logs activities when visitors view [pages](documentation/business-users/website-content) or submit [forms](documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/forms) on the site.
The gathered activity data allows you to evaluate the behavior of your contacts and their interactions across your content channels.
## View contact activities
Once you or your project’s administrators have [set up tracking of activities](documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/set-up-activities), you can monitor the activities of all [contacts](documentation/business-users/digital-marketing/contact-management) in the **Contact management** application on the **Activities** tab.
The activity log shows you which actions your visitors performed, such as page visits or form submissions.
