Content hub provides a way for users to create, store, manage, and publish content across multiple channels. Each piece of content is stored in the hub as a reusable [content item](documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-items).
Content items can be organized into [folders](documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-hub-folders). [Content item assets](documentation/business-users/content-hub/content-item-assets) allow users to store various types of files that can be reused throughout the system. To learn more about how to structure the content in your project, see [Content modeling](guides/architecture/content-modeling/content-modeling-guide) guide.
The Content hub application is scoped under [workspaces](documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/users/role-management/workspaces), allowing content stored inside it to be separated into distinct workspaces.
The Content hub UI allows you to view all content items in the system:

When you have access to multiple workspaces you can switch between them using the workspace switcher located in the header bar. [![Workspace switcher](docsassets/documentation/content-hub/workspace_switcher.png)](https://docs.kentico.com/docsassets/documentation/content-hub/workspace_switcher.png)
