# Create media libraries
**Media libraries sunset**
Media libraries have been officially sunset, and their related API members have been marked as obsolete. Support for media libraries will continue for one more year (until July 24, 2026), after which the feature and all associated APIs will be completely removed.
See [Media library migration](/guides/architecture/media-libraries-migration-guidance) for instructions on how to migrate your media library files to [Content hub](/documentation/business-users/content-hub).
To create media libraries in your project:
  1. Open the **Media libraries** application.
  2. Select **New media library**.
  3. Enter the following details: 
     * **Media library name** – the name of the media library displayed in the administration and on the live site.
     * _(Optional)_ **Identifiers** – specify the code name if you wish to use a code name different than the pre-filled value.
     * **Description** – text describing the media library.
     * **Folder name** – the name of the folder where files will be stored in the file system.
  4. **Save** the created media library.


The system creates the media library and the associated folder on the file system. An editing interface for the media library appears.
On the **General** tab, you can edit the properties that you entered when creating the media library:
![]()
[]()[]()
