# Media libraries
**Media libraries sunset**
Media libraries have been officially sunset, and their related API members have been marked as obsolete. Support for media libraries will continue for one more year (until July 24, 2026), after which the feature and all associated APIs will be completely removed.
See [Media library migration](/guides/architecture/media-libraries-migration-guidance) for instructions on how to migrate your media library files to [Content hub](/documentation/business-users/content-hub).
Using the **Media libraries** application, you can store various types of files in Xperience, for example, photos, pictures, sound files, videos, package files, presentations, or document files. Despite its name, media libraries allow you to store non-media types of files as well.
**Do not use media libraries to store files that are not intended for public use**
We strongly advise against using media libraries to store files for which you want to limit access. Media library files are always accessible at their direct URL by their GUID (e.g., _example.com/getmedia/3b60d630-0016-4432-9aa1-34e57521abe4/which-brewing-fits-you-1080px.jpg_).
