## Get familiar with the Xperience by Kentico API
The API examples documentation helps developers learn the basics of the Xperience by Kentico API and serves as a library of code snippets. The examples demonstrate how to use the API to manage the system’s objects, including basic operations (creating, retrieving, updating and deleting) and in some cases more advanced tasks. The full API Reference is available at <https://api-reference.kentico.com/>.
The examples are organized into the following categories:
  * [Configuration](api/configuration)
  * [Content management](api/content-management)
  * [Development](api/development)
  * [Digital marketing](api/digital-marketing)


**Tips** :
  * The API examples in the documentation do not include the required _using_ statements for Xperience by Kentico API namespaces. As long as your project references the Xperience libraries (or contains the _Kentico.Xperience.Libraries_ NuGet package), you can use Visual Studio Quick Actions to quickly [Generate usings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/generate-usings).


**API usage guidelines**
See [API usage](documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/stable-customization-guidelines#api-usage) for information on using the Xperience by Kentico API in a way that minimizes problems when updating to newer versions.
For example, API contained in namespaces with the **.Internal** suffix is not intended for public use. Such API should be considered unstable and subject to breaking changes during **any update** (even outside of major releases).
