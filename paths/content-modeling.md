#  Learning path: Content modeling.
Structure your content for consistency, reuse, and long-term flexibility
Before your team can deliver content to websites, emails, or apps, you need a solid structure behind the scenes. That’s where content modeling comes in.
This **Content modeling** learning path shows you how to plan and build a flexible content structure that supports both long-term development and daily content work. Whether you’re designing your first model or refining an existing one, this path gives you practical guidance to create models that are easy to maintain, scalable, and editor-friendly.
You’ll learn how to:
  * Plan structured content that separates layout from content.
  * Design content types that support reuse, consistency, and clear responsibilities.
  * Collaborate with content editors and stakeholders to validate your model.
  * Create presentation components that align with your content model and scale with your project.


Whether you’re a web architect planning the overall structure or a developer building the components, this learning path helps you create a system that supports great content; today and in the future.
