#  Learning path: Customization and integration - introduction.
Adapt and extend Xperience to match your project's unique requirements.
Every project has different requirements, and as a developer, you need the flexibility to adapt Xperience by Kentico to meet those needs. Whether configuring channel-specific behavior, extending default functionality, or integrating with external systems, this learning path shows you how to customize the platform in innovative, scalable ways.
The **Customization and integration** path walks you through everyday developer tasks that help turn a generic project into a tailored digital experience platform. These tutorials are hands-on, code-first, and designed to help you build real solutions without unnecessary complexity.
You’ll learn how to:
  * Create custom modules that support different configurations for different website channels.
  * Extend built-in objects (like contacts) with custom fields to capture domain-specific data.
  * Choose the right approach for integrating Xperience with external services, whether you’re triggering custom logic or syncing data.


By the end of this path, you can confidently extend and integrate your Xperience project, or add the functionality your business users need without compromising performance or maintainability.
